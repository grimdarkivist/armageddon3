<P>Our forces were slowly being pushed back by the Orks.  We had just gotten a meal in and were in the course of devouring it when we heard the Orks beginning their attack.  We stuffed as much food in our mouths as we could, leapt up, and grabbed our weapons. </P>

<P>A unit of Trukk boyz ran into one of our squads and quickly disembarked.  In a few short seconds, none of the guardsmen were left standing, and the Trukk boyz quickly advanced into Black Templar Terminators.  The Terminators made short work of the Trukk boyz but before they had a brief moments rest, they were attacked by a warboss and his retinue.  It was a vicious fight and both sides maneouvered for advantage but as they did so, they lost valuable members to powerclaws and powerfists.  The warboss clove in the heads of the terminators and the powerfists found their marks and rent gaping holes in flesh.  The surviving terminator slowly teetered, firing off his storm bolter into advancing orks, and then fell over.</P>

<P>Our Ogryn unit was attacked by deth koptas in a swirling melee but it wasn't long before the tall ogryns grabbed the koptas and swung them into the ground.  The pilots tried to jump free from the crash but as they did so, they leapt into the swirling rotors and were minced in a matter of seconds.</P>

<P>All along our front, the Orks were piling into our squads, and we were suffering horrible casualties.  Whole squads were being decimated in a matter of seconds when the Orks made it to melee and our shooting seemed to have no effect at all.  Surviving Orks were climbing all over our armour, shoving stikbombz and grenades in every opening they could find, destroying each vehicle. Those vehicles that the Orks couldn't destroy had rocks and sticks shoved in their gun barrels and veiwports to render them useless.  Ork dreadnoughts and kans advanced into them flipping them over or destroying them.</P>

<P>Orders came through and we were to gain control of the communications building, eliminate Orks from the surrounding area, and receive vital data transmissions.  The Templars advanced alongside their Crusader which was spitting death into the Ork horde.  The Marines slowly advanced and fired their bolters as they trudged forward.  The Crusader crashed into an Ork mob, its frag assault launchers firing off into the Orks, smiting them down. The assault ramp crashed down on top of an unlucky Ork and the Templars surged forth from the Crusader.  The first Templar out of the tank lopped the head off an Ork and fired his bolt pistol into the mob.  The Orks snarled and counter-charged into the Templars surging from the Crusader.  The sheer ferocity displayed by the Templars was too much for the Orks and they fell by the dozens. In a matter of a few seconds, the Orks were hacked to the ground and the survivors were off and away. The Templars advanced to secure one side of the building. </P>

<P>As the Templars moved forward, unbeknownst to them, a unit of kans was coming around the corner of the building and charged them.  The  swirling saws of the kans made short work of their power armour and they were dispatched in service of the Emperor.  Even in their death, duty did not end, as they knocked the legs from one kan, which toppled over, and one Templar sacrificed himself to plant a krak grenade on the vision slit of one kan, destroying them both in a brilliant flash.</P>

<P>The Orks swarmed forth and all we could do was to fall back and take up new positions.  They might have won this battle, but we will win the war and rid them from Armageddon, once and for all.  For the Emperor!</P>

<BR CLEAR>

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/charlietraylor.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT>Nightfall crept in and the Orks crawled back into their hiding places from whence they came.  It was the Orks job to scrounge as much ammo, weapons and fuel together during the cover of darkness before the Imperials became aggressive and decided to counter-attack.   Throughout the evening small pockets of resistance reached out with sporadic weapons fire but all and all the evening was quiet. </P> 

<P>The Orks squinted as the sun slowly peaked its shape above the horizon and the warbosses smiled showing their a big toof grin as they anticipated the morning offensive.  The slow whirling of the Deth Koptas rotors began to accelerate and the pilots rattled off a few rounds of their big shootas to confirm their operation.  One Ork's twin big shootas jammed and the frustrated pilot screamed for a grot rigga to 'fix' the problem.  The grot noticed the level of annoyance in the big Ork and he quickly grabbed a mallet and began pounding the barrels of the weapon until the shells dislodged thru the grots innards.  The Ork chuckled to himself and he lifted off his war machine into the sky and fell into Orky formation with the rest of the Deth Koptas.</P> 

<P>Yesterday's set back was only minor and the ability to attack today with a full warband felt great.  Warboss Zigzagga had been reinforced during the evening hours and he planned his attack with his most loyal warbosses throughout the night.  The plan was clear, attack and take the largest building in the center of the ruins.  Warboss Zigzagga's spies had also informed their warlord that the 'oomies had messengers seeking to enter the large building and extract information revealing the location of all Ork offensives, troop consistency, leaders, and support vehicles. Needless to say the concentration of warfare centered around and in the large administorum building but the 'oomies were unable to gain a foothold.  </P> 

<P>Hundreds maybe even thousands of boyz flooded around the building while dreadnoughts and killa kans littered the area providing support for the Orks.  The speed freeks were hitting the flanks of the ruins crushing the Imperial defenses creating a pincer move surrounding and securing the building.  Meanwhile, the dreadnoughts and kans pushed past the building, and invigorated by the bloodlust of battle, pushed forward meeting the fresh Imperial reinforcements well behind the frontlines.  All of a sudden, as quickly as flicking a switch the sun was eclipsed by one of the orbiting moons and the sky became dark as night.  We didn't know how long it would last but the opportunity to move under the cover of darkness was to good to be true.  Most Orks quieted their weapons as to not alert the 'oomies from their muzzle flashes and crept forward waiting to pounce like some of the great hunting cats.  Flares arched in the air and illuminated large pockets of the battlefield only to show that the Orks were advancing too fast to be stopped.  Then again as if Mork or Gork flicked another switch the sun shined onto the planets surface and it was daylight.  Expressions of surprise shown on the faces of the 'oomies were the last reaction they had when they realized that Orks were sharing their trenches.  The boyz cut down 'oomies well before they could defend themselves and the orks quickly disposed of all defenders cowering in the trench works.  By the early evening the remains of Imperial vehicles and the bodies of the fallen were the only sign of the enemy.  Our kommandos had infiltrated the building and set explosives preventing the enemy from ever obtaining the information they so desperately wanted.  Victory of a new kind occurred today and Warboss Zigzagga was pleased but we still had revenge and the desire for planet destruction on our minds.  WAAAGH!!!</P>
