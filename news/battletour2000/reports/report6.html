<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/ianspinkviewscreen.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=RIGHT>We had just gained a foothold in the refinery area but it wasn't enough.  We really needed possession of the tanks and the precious fuel contained therein. Fresh troops were brought in, some of them very green, and moved out to take our objective. Gathering as many transports as we could get our hands onto, we raced across the battlefield to snatch the oil tanks from the hands of the Orks.  We poured fire into the Orks to support the troops within the transports and the green scum took a heavy toll.</P>

<P>Near the center, the Ogryns blasted away with their ripper guns at point blank range into the orks. Many of the aliens were felled.  Those that were still standing were quickly pounded down by the Ogryns in a quick melee.  Surprisingly, the Orks welcomed this chance at close combat and countercharged by the dozens.  A heavy toll was taken by the Orks but they did not run. Stubborn brutes! The Ogryns had the upper hand until the klanking dreadnoughts entered the fray.  With a few swings of their crude close combat weapons, the Ogryns were messily dispatched.  Luckily our aim had proven to be effective enough and we eliminated almost all the orks from our flank.</P>

<P>The Black Templars moved forward in their Landraider Crusader, guns blazing away as it went.  It slowly drove across the pitted battlefield towards a large oil storage platform, eliminating pockets of orks as it went.  Under heavy fire from the Orks, it looked like it was not going to be able to make the distance but its strong armor held.  It drove upon the oil platform and disgorged an entire squad of Templars.  Fifteen marines on the oil platform would prove very difficult for the Orks to remove.</P>

<P>An Armoured Fist squad raced across the battlefield and took another oil platform.  Ork resistance was very light at this point but there was still sporadic firing and the occasional charge from the Orks.  We had succeeded in our mission and the oil tanks were ours but could we hold them.</P>

<P>After a brief lull in the battle, the Orks came at us with reinforcements.  One unit of trukkboyz managed to wipe out a squad of guardsmen in a brutal assault and push through to an  unsuspecting unit Space Wolf bikers. A terrible combat ensued that left most of the combatants from both sides unable to continue.</P>  

<P>The Orks came at us from all sides and we butchered them as they came but there were too many. The survivors that made it to our lines hacked our defending troops to bits forcing us to pay a terrible price. The Orks seemed to be stronger than ever and we found it impossible to hold them back. Their Stormboyz cut through our Ratling snipers on the left flank and recaptured an oil storage tank. The Black Templars in the center came under assault by Nobz in mega-armor, dreadnoughts, and orks. This proved to be too much and they were unable to withstand the assault. The Orks mercilessly cut down the Templars and secured another oil tank. We were forced to fall back under the Ork advance and abandon parts of the refinery.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/justinkviewscreen.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=LEFT>Warboss Legsnappa had his grot riggas fix his damaged battle fortress and when it was operable, he quickly left for the Ork battlelines. We boyz noticed that Warboss Zigzagga did not move with the confidence that he had when he first took over after Warboss Skulkrusha met with fate. One particular nob boy, whom I don�t know, quickly grew in size and stature and challenged Zigzaggas right to rule. This one ork revolt was all the Warboss Zigzagga needed to regain his confidence and control of the boyz. Within moments the nob was pounded into the ground and run over several times by Zigzagga in his trukk.</P>
  
<P><I>"Mownt up boyz and let dis b a lessin to ya.  I <B>IZ</B> da boss and youze boyz betta not fergit,"</I> Zigzagga boasted as he stood above the body of his former rival.  Even though several boyz watched this battle for control, a war was raging all around us.  Explosions and the familiar sound of 'oomie weapons rattled off in the distance and the refinery was slowly being retaken by the 'oomie offensive.  We beat off the attack and held the 'oomies around the middle of the complex.  It almost seemed as if they designed their own speed freeks because all we saw over the horizon was vehicle transports and heavily armoured marines with rockets on their backs.  Our mekboyz and grot riggas were hard at work trying to fix any vehicles or bikes they found on the battlefield.  Also, our reinforcements from the landing roks were slowly coming to a halt and we now had to pick and choose our attacks.  Warboss Zigzagga thought it would be a good idea to try and hold the refinery but we believe a good offense is the best defense.  So with little speed freek support the boyz set off to try and recapture the outskirts of the refinery complex.  It was a long bitter struggle, and with 'oomie troops positioned in well defended areas, it was hard to kill them all.</P>  

<P>By midday we crept up to the edge of some of the refinery buildings and began brutal hand-to-hand combat with the enemy.  Several Dreadnoughts and Killa Kans hungered for the opportunity to crush some skulls and they got their chance under the cover of looted Leman Russ tanks and shoota boyz.  The evening swept in on the battle and our bodies cast huge shadows over the dead 'oomies.  The mighty Waaagh had gained its momentum once again and even our worthless grots had reached the main battleline and were killing guardsmen by the dozen.  Gork and Mork would be proud of us on such a great victory as today.  It seems to me that if we can produce as many casaulities as we did today everyday, we should win this war on attrition alone.  The Kommandos and Tank Busta boyz are anxious for nightfall so they can sneak into enemy encampments and destroy as much as possible.  I have also noticed that what began as a mighty Waaagh for our great warboss Ghazghkull Thraka has now mutated into a personal grudge match within all of us boyz.</P>
