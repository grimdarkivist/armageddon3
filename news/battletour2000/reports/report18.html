<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/markjacobs.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=LEFT>I received a com report from the Master of the Ravenwing telling me of the trouble with the leadership of the XXX Armageddon Steel Legion forces and the Asgardian squads that have been transferred under them. The leadership in this wazone has been troubled as of late and the time to act is now. I have taken it upon myself to lead these forces to their true potential of victory. My adjunct Commissar Timma has been appointed to command the Asgardian squads while I will lead the Steel Legion squads. Timma is a fomer student of mine and his leadership should prove invaluable. </P>

<P ALIGN=RIGHT><I>-Commissar Yarrick: Acting Commander of the XXX Armageddon Steel Legion 
</I></P>

<P>With a renewed sense of purpose the Imperial Guard have rallied around Commissar Yarrick. Using stout silence in the face of the boistrous Ork horde, the forces of the Imperium have gained the momentum that is needed to carry them on to victory.  The only answer the Orks will have is that of their bodies being crushed by the tracks of our Chimeras.</P>

<P>Our goal was to get as many of the Steel Legion forces of Hel's highway leading to the dock. This came to pass because of a Basilisk shot that destroyed one of the suicide trukks that was heading toward our lines. The ensuing explosion destroyed a quarter of the Ork forces that entrenched themselves in the way of our objective. Our forces were not exempt of the mayhem caused by the explosion. The lone Salamander that was defending his fallen Battle Brothers joined them. Two Chimeras along with two of Yarricks bodyguards were destroyed and  even Commissar Yarrick himself was thrown to the ground. This did not set Yarrick's back and when he rose from the crater he was swamped by the Ork Warboss and his retunue of Nobz.</P>

<P>In a spectacular display of courage and skill, Yarrick managed to dispatch the Nobz and the Warboss. With a man like him leading the forces of Armageddon, we may yet have a chance.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/joeroberts.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT>I waz leadin' da boyz in battle and saw all da oomie trukks making' for a fast run for da road to da docks. We all tried ta cut 'em off but we ran inta a littl' problem. Da Big Boss Gutz Eater had a plan ta load some fuel in da empty trukks and drive 'em to da oomies so dey blow up. Sum of da ovver Bosses were trying dis out but no one was left ta tell uz what happened. One of dere Big Gunz hit da demo trukk and blew everyting up, even some of our own boyz, and dat Yarrick boss.</P>

<P>Gutz Eater saw dis and drove his trukk over to try and get the body for Big Boss Ghazghkull. But when he got dere Yarrick got up from da hole and stompped him and da Nobz boyz dat waz wifh 'em. Dis made it a bad day for da boyz but a good day for me. Now I will lead da boyz to victory!</P>
