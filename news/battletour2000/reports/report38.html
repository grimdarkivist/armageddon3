<P>A no holds barred event to control the strategic ground between the docks and Helsreach has begun. The Orks would rue the day they decided to face the human forces. The Valhallans set up a thin line of forces in across the battlefield, supported only by a small force of Sisters of Battle. The Orks infiltrated large mobs of boyz who were intent on breaking though the pitiful human resistance. As the day went on, the Orks began to wish they had picked a different target than the determined Valhallans. </P>

<P>The day began to go bad as mortar and Basilisk fire rained down on the boyz. The Speed Freaks sent against the Chapel to silence the Imperial guns were driven back by the might and fire of the Sisters of Battle. Though many Sisters fell, they protected the artillery. This would prove a crucial blow to the Orks, slowing their drive and killing most of their vehicles. As the boyz drove towards the lines, they were withered away by Valhallan firepower. By noon the field was clear of Orks, and the Valhallans drew back to allow the Steel Legion and Salamanders to advance.</P>  

<P>Though the first push had been wiped out, the Orks responded by sending in a large force of Speed Freaks. If they could silence the human guns and crush the mechanized forces coming in they could still seize control of this crucial area. Both sides stormed across the board leaving the hulks of enemy vehicles in their wake. Again, the Sisters prevented the Imperial Artillery from falling and that was the crucial difference in the afternoons fighting. No matter how hard the Orks struggled to take down the Steel Legion, their efforts came to naught under the pounding of Imperial guns. By the end of the day the Orks were in full retreat.</P>
