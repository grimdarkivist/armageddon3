<P>The Black Templars formed a battleline on the right flank. They were ready for whatever the Orks could throw at them. Ork warbikes drove into their line and were quickly engaged. After a hard fought combat, all the warbikes were destroyed and the Templars advanced towards the Orks.</P>  

<P>All along the line the Orks were on us very quickly, giving us no time for manuever or counter attack. All we could do was fight back and pray that the Emperor would guide us through. Ork warbikes and Koptas hit the center of our line and we fought back like madmen possessed. No sooner had we wiped them out with careful shooting and countercharges than a massive unit of Orks piled into us and we were in the thick of it again. Many soldiers went down before we were able to defeat that mob and once we had done so, Ork kans piled into us. We didn't have anything to fight them off and the slaughter was terrible. Our center quickly fell and the kans advanced into our armor and made short work of them.</P>

<P>The Sisters advanced towards the center in an attempt to take a power station from Ork hands. The Seraphim squads jumped towards their objective with the battlesquads close behind.  From out of nowhere, an Ork mob supported by buggies slammed into the Seraphim squads and swept them away in a wave of greenskin violence and mayhem. The Orks continued to advance and fell into the battle squads and tore them apart in an orgy of violence and victory. The Orks kept the power station and swept into the Imperial line and left not a single human standing.</P>

<P>The Black Templars swept towards their objective destroying Orks, bikes, and whatever else got in their path.  Their righteous fury was unstoppable and the Orks scrambled to get out of their way and avoid the punishing powerfists and cleaving chainswords.  The Terminators carved a path of ruin through the Orks to secure the flank of the Templar advance.  The Templar's Crusader blasted Orks to pieces as it rumbled towards the objective, crushing walls and bodies in an unstoppable advance.</P>

<P>The Orks swarmed over most of our positions and we were unable to secure our objectives.  The Templars had achieved theirs but this was to only give us a glimmer of hope in the next few days.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/orkstormboyguy.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT>The adrenaline of the boyz wore off and we hid amongst the rubble for the evening.  Once day broke we decided to advance forward again and not give the 'oomies an opportunity to replenish their losses. The 'oomies gave us a chance to regroup throughout the evening and the speed freeks decided to concentrate their forces on the eastern flank of the enemy. To their surprise the line defenses had changed hands and the mighty forces of the Black Templars were garrisoning the trenches. The bikes and koptas of the Speed Freeks hit hard and fast and only traces of gun fire and large clouds of black smoke could be seen and heard from the battle lines. The mobs of Stormboyz ignited their jump packs and launched themselves into the smoke without any concern for themselves or the danger that lies ahead.  Towards the middle of the battlefield and the western fringes Ork boyz were following closely behind the Dreadnoughts and Killa Kans that lead the way.  Large 'oomie tanks rumbled and exploded several advancing kans but the vast majority pushed their way through the remains while the boyz screamed Ork obscenities toward the 'oomie lines.  Warboss Headkrusha, a newly appointed warboss, found it very difficult to motivate his nob retinue.  Within minutes of the outbreak of gunfire in the morning Warboss Headkrusha engaged his nobz in what soon became mortal combat.  The warboss lay motionless in only a few moments and the nobz in their heavy mega armour stood near him bickering who would become the new boss.</P>  

<P>Meanwhile, the boyz marched forward not knowing the disaster occurring behind them.  The boyz fought valiantly without visual contact of their warboss but thinking he was watching probably kept them enraged and willing to die for greater glory. The Dreadnoughts virtually engaged every vehicle within sight and lurching their power claws into the vehicles belly instantly caused all sorts of inner and outer explosions.  Burning 'oomies leapt from hatches and screamed until the fire silenced them forever.  The boyz were excited to see the dying guardmen and ran forward chopping down 'oomies without even breaking stride.  Warbuggies and Wartraks were also zooming forward laying down huge swathes of burning fuel and shoota shells.</P>  

<P>The Speed Freeks on the other hand were having difficulties removing the Black Templars from their position and several Trukk boy mobs and the Stormboyz have not been seen or heard from in quite some time.  We also witnessed several pods hit the planets surface during what would probably be the heaviest fighting for the day.  The pods disgorged several more blasted Black Templars and they began cutting down boyz in a deadly crossfire.  Fortunately, Warboss Zigzagga reacted quickly and sent several Kill Kans and some Dreadnoughts to quell the counter-attack.  The addition of forces kept the marines from advancing any further on the battlefield and it gave the boyz ample enough time to establish defensive positions within the ruined buildings.  We also noticed some rogue Deth Koptas suicidally advancing upon the enemy lines.  One Ork crew noticed the commissar that had escaped just one day before and began a strafing attack on him and his bodyguard.  The commissar's retinue unable to respond quickly enough allowed him to receive several shoota rounds right in the chest slumping him over a pile of sandbags.  The Ork pilot howled in triumph not noticing the Ogryn that proceeded to bat him out of the air, crashing the Deth Kopta into the side of a Chimera.</P>  

<P>Throughout the afternoon the battle raged on and we held the vitally important ruins that were located towards the center of the outskirts.  Now Warboss Zigzagga wanted us to concentrate on the 'oomie vehicles because the firepower for them was crippling our Speed Freeks advance.  He called for our Tank Bustas, and lootas to rush forward and destroy as many tanks as possible.  The rest of the boyz attempted to creat a diversion long enough for the tank bustas to get in range.  The ploy didn't work but the lootas were able to get off a couple of lucky shots to eradicate some imperial vehicles.  The Dreadnoughts were having more success in punching holes in the enemies lines and advancing into melee combat with the tanks.  All in all the day was ours and great glory was to be had for Warlord Ghazghkull.  We now need to secure our advance and make way towards the highway in the hopes of taking Helsreach within the next few days.</P>
