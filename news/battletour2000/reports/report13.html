Grot Revolutionary Dispatch</P>

<P>Attension Oomie Boss</P>

<P>We iz da Grot Revolusion and we wants ta fight da Orks wif ya. Dey kicks uz around too much and we iz trough wifh dem. In da last battle we waz told ta hold deze stickbommas and attacks dose Big Shootas you got. We iz good grotz and did what we waz told. But when my boys waz stuck to da Shooty trukks and blew up wifh 'em dat was just too much. So a couple of da Grotz jumpped on to da Whipper and he blew up to. We have had enough and wantz to know if ya wants ta fight wiv uz. Da word iz spreadin' and da Grotz is coming out of da ground and leavin' da Ork oppression.</P>

<P>Skabby - Grot Revolutionary</P>
 
<P>I have been approached by a Grot and asked if I would join the Grot Revolution. I do not think I share the same views as these little aliens but the sheer number of my forces cannot withstand another assault. I have not told Commissar Mull about these circumstances and do not think that he needs to know where exactly my reinforcements are coming from.</P>

<P>Commissar Mull recently approached me and he already knew about the Grotz and approves of the action I am taking. "Better they shed their green blood for us rather than for our enimies."</P> 

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/robeverrette.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=LEFT>The orders arrived today that we must begin our push to the sea. The Steel Legion will lead the way and will be the moral booster that the troops need so desperately. The initial rush took some casualities but there were light considering. The Grotz  are playing a major role in this battle and have already destroyed three squads of the greenskins along with a squad of Mega Armored Orks. I am glad I have associated my forces with them and the reinforcements I have asked for have finally arrived. My flanking force reports that the Dark Angels have arrived led by the Ravenwing. Now the tide shall truly turn in our favor.</P>

<P>The battle is reaching its climax, this will be my last entry until the post battle report to HQ.</P>

<P>Dark Angel Comm Link Intercept</P>

<P>Target acquired, we are going in..</P>

<P>Imperial Commander. By aligning yourself with the alien scum you have fallen from the Emperor's light. Your death shall absolve the sins of those that your orders have so cowardly corrupted...DAKKA! DAKKA! DAKKA!</P>

<P>Attention Steel Legion and Asgardian forces. We have cleansed the battlefield of your traitorous commander and his fallen Commissar. Our fight is with the Orks. You may return to the Emperor's light by laying down your lives for the cause. Or you will be our next targets, after we have dealt death to the Greenskins.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/heretic.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=RIGHT>We wuz doin' just fine workin' wiv our buddies, da Azguards. We got some Boyz and a few trukks and even some of dem 'ard Boyz wif da armor. Our leada called for help "Viva La Revolsion" and da grotz answered da call and came runnin'. Den our buddy da capn' waz shot down by da 'ard oomies on da fancy bikes. Our allizanze wif da oomies may not be so good right now but da revousion will NEVER DIE!!! - Skabby</P> 

<P>I don't know what I am goinna tell da Big Boss. He aint gonna be happy when he hears about all dis mess. Da Grotz is leaving all of da camps and da ones dat stick around aint helpin' wiv da work no more. On top of dat dem oomies wiv dem fancy trukks broke through our lines today. We could not evenslow 'em down let alone stop 'em. Ta top everything off my boyz waz getting a beatin' put on 'em by da Grotz. Dey just kept coming out of da ruins and da sewers and wuz screamin' all dis craziness "somfin le revolusion." I did not understand what happened or what got into dem Grotz but I wish dey fought for me today. </P>
