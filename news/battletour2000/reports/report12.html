My search for reinforcements has not shown promise. The advance scouts returned from the local nomad camps only to report that they were deserted. One scout reported seeing some greenskins in one of the camps but he was not fired on. Perhaps they did not see him but he swears that they had him dead to rights. He is still receiving the Emperor�s blessing in the chapel.</P>
 
<P>The Orks once again came upon us only this time it would appear that they were carrying supplies in make shift vehicles. They made for our lines but did not stop once they were upon us; they just broke right through. Just then the comm-link blurted out that we should stop all attempts by the Orks of repositioning their forces. This was an obvious order and one that we were already attempting to do.</P>
 
<P>The lines were rapidly disintegrating and the Asgardians that were holding the Cathedral were the only troops that seemed relatively safe from being crushed under the massive vehicles of the Orks. Even my Steel Legion platoons did not have the safety of their Chimeras as they were sent back to gather more supplies. The Salamanders once again broke through our comm-links and told us that they would bring the vengeance of the Emperor to the field of battle. They took positions where the once proud Guardsmen stood but it was too late. The lines had been broken and many of the Ork supplies sped off through the ruins.</P>

<P>The Orks tried to breakthrough again but were surrounded on both sides. They tried to direct all of their attacks against one flank but were shot to pieces when they attempted to assault the Imperial lines.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/ericandrobbieg.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=LEFT>Da boss was happy dat we got da extra ammo and supplies da boyz needed. We had some of da ammo for our gunz too! More Dakka, More Dakka, More Dakka. Da oomies will not know what hit 'em. Da big buildin' is still a place of saftey for da oomies and da Runtherda had an idea to get them outta there. We glued Krak Stikkabombz to da Grotz hands and sent dem to blow up all da oomie tanks. It took dem a while to get dere 'cause dey had to crawl underground. But Grotz is used ta dat kinda stuff.</P> 

<P>We followed da oomies dat were fallin' back in the middle of da lines but den all dese oomie tanks were on both sides of uz. We tried to blow up one group at a time but by the time the one group wuz stomped we wuz shot up too much by both of the guard armies.</P> 

<P>Da Grotz finally got into position and blew up a Big Shoota Tank and a few squads of oomies. Da one bad thing was dat the Runtherda never came back and come to tink of it dem Grotz neva showed up eiver.</P>
