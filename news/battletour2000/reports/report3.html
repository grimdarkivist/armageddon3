<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/scott_viewscreen.jpg" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Scott Taylor" ALIGN=RIGHT>It was almost daylight and we prayed for the night to be end. We could hear the Orks moving about but there was no way to know what they were up to. The Orks had captured a few Oil storage tanks earlier, but we still held on to some as well. Our commanders were relentless in the fact that we could not yield ground to the Ork menace. We were stationed inside the oil pumping house in the center of the battlefield with a commanding view, but the waiting was terrible.</P>

<P>Then the storm broke. The Orks massed forward on the left flank and on the right there was a cloud of smoke, dust advancing upon us.  We fired as fast as we could but still the Orks surged forward. The Black Templars fought against the Ork bikers and flying machines with a fury never seen before. They were outnumbered at least 10 to 1 as the Orks drove their bikes right into full squads, running right over marines and sometimes coming to a sudden stop.  The Black Templars fought valiantly and managed to utterly destroyed them.  The Templars held their objectives with only a few small pockets of Orks to deal with. On the left, masses of boyz ran upon to us shooting and shouting as they went. The Mordians defending this flank fought hard but to no avail, as the Orks proved too powerful and overran their positions, gleefully hacking away at the brave defenders.</P>

 <P>In the center a Leman Russ supported by an Armored Fist squad raced towards the Ork held oil storage platform.  Moments later the Russ went up in smoke as a massed attack of Ork Killa Kans engaged and destroyed it with their crude cutting tools and torches.  The supporting squad jumped out of their Chimera and laced devastating fire everywhere along the advancing Ork mobz. One unit was caught in a firefight and retreated right into the blazing guns of this Armoured Fist squad. Die Ork scum, we shall rid this planet of your foul presence. On all points were were under assault from the Orks and were slowly being pushed back.  Never before has the battlefield been such an utter scene of carnage and destruction. We redoubled our efforts into the Ork battleline as we were determined to retake the objectives that are rightfully ours. We assaulted the Orks every chance we had and the fire from our tanks and artillery hit home. Orks died by the hundreds and we destroyed those that were still moving forward. "Let none survive!" was our motto for the day and we did just that.  We pushed back into the Ork horde and drove them back, retaking our objectives and claiming a small victory for the Imperium.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/don_viewscreen.jpg" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Don Morris" ALIGN=LEFT>Griz Mag Zigzagga slapped the grot rigger on the back of the head, sending the tiny creature off the fuel tank of Zigzagga's trukk. The sun just began to rise and there were heavy shadows all over the battlefield. <I>"Now iz da time to take alla da ommie fuul"</I>, Griz Mag thought to himself as he lifted his giant choppa in the air and waved his army forward. The Speed Freeks brought their engines to life with a roar and hurtled toward the ommie defensive line. The rest of the slower boyz were left back at the fuel stations already under Ork control. They were placed under the watchful eye of Warboss Ragnatz Legsnappa, a warboss not known for his patience or his kindness toward the enemy.</P>

<P>The Speed Freeks careened forward and Warboss Legsnappa immediately felt cheated as he watched them leave. He would be unable to kill the wretched 'ommies from here! So without hesitation or deliberation Warboss Legsnappa began marching forward with the bellow of his war cry signaling his boyz to follow.</P>

<P>Combat was now on all fronts and throughout the day the Orks pushed to the edge of the refinery and closed in on their final objectives, the pump station and processing plants. The Orks also found themselves facing a new enemy, an enemy that Speed Boss Zigzagga was familiar with. He called them the Black Death but we heard other ommies call them Black Templars. They were ruthless and respectable opponents. Unlike most puny ommies that would fall back to an Ork charge, they'd instead immediately counter charge with anger and purpose. These Black Templars relentlessly held several vital refinery plants and the Orks were only able to control the buildings for brief moments until being beaten back.</P>

<P>The Ork lootas were able to repair some equipment and use them against their former owners. They quickly fixed tanks and weapons that helped keep the Ork army surging forward. By the time of our second feeding (that's dinner to you and me) da boyz positions had froze and neither side was able to gain any new ground. The fact that the 'ommies controlled the important processing plants and stations gave them the upper hand until we could figure out a way to capture the facility for good. Hopefully, our failure will not bring the attention of Ghazghkull Thraka? Many boyz fear him more than the enemy. We need to take this facility, we need to be further up the highway, we need to kill more 'ommies, we need to win this Waaagh! for Gork and Mork.
