<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/allison_viewscreen.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=RIGHT>Dusk was arriving fast and we had little time to rest. A huge explosion erupted from one of our command posts, obliterating the staff in a orange ball of flame.  The orks will bleed for that.  The Orks came at us as they always do, yelling, revving engines, and blasting guns in the air.  By now it was apparent that the Orks didn't possess any real tactical battle sense, instead they just came at you in a wave and either crashed through you or were held in check.</P>

<P>One our right flank, the Ork units plowed through through two Guard units dispatching all to the Emperor's paradise.  It looked like were we in serious trouble on that flank but a combination of Demolisher, Griffon, and obstinate Guard shooting cut down most of the Orks.  Those that survived our shooting were quickly assaulted and destroyed and our right flank was secure.</P>

<P>In the center, a pack of stormboyz assaulted a Hellhound and placed anti-tank charges all over the beast.  It went up in a huge ball of flame and smoke, blowing shrapnel and burning fuel in a wide arc.  Many of the stormboyz were caught in the explosion and died instantly as well as some of our men.  The surviving stormboyz picked themselves up off the ground and immediately jumped towards our Basilisk and destroyed it too, though not as spectacularly.  We dispatched the rest of the stormboyz with our lasguns and heavy bolters.</P>

<P>In the center of the battlefield, our troops were dropping left and right.  The Orks were really strong in the center, being supported by traks, truks, buggies, dreadnoughts, and looted tanks.  Even the mega-armour Orks were there trying to lead the charge.  We tried to destroy as many as possible but we couldn�t hold them off.  Mobs of little Gretchin charged forward and drove us out of our objective into the open where we faced sudden death if we didn�t find cover soon.  We fell back to a ruined building and began shooting at the Orks once more, though our hearts weren�t quite in it.  The Orks were slowly pushing us back into the outer reaches of the Hive and it was there we would have to make a strong stand or all of Helreach could be doomed.</P>

<P>We fell back and prepared better defensive positions and quickly ate a cold meal. We worked on fortifying our defenses by piling doors, barrels, and anything else we could get our hands on, forming barriers for the ork advance and cover for us.  The Orks would enter a maelstrom of death and destruction of not which one would survive.</P> 

<P>After about three hours of preparation, the Orks began sneaking through the ruins.  We didn't give them too much opportunity and opened fire as soon as we could.  It was a decisive moment as some Orks became confused and milled about, others broke and ran, and some came at us.  Of the units that came at us, the Koptas kept on going past us not to be seen again.  Did they have an alterior motive such as disrupting our supply lines or just creating more havoc than there was already?  It didn't matter, they were gone and we had Orks in front of us that we needed to kill.  We fired into them and they dropped, only to have the open spots fill with more Orks.  The Praetorians held a strong center and didn't let the Orks get too close.  After about 30 minutes the Orks began to fall back and started regrouping just out of range.  We lobbed a few mortar shells into them to keep them disrupted and sent the stormtroopers ahead to report on their activity.</P>

<P>After monitoring the Orks for over an hour, the stormtroopers reported that the Orks were again massing in strength and preparing for a fresh attack.  In our minds, we knew this was the case and it was not reassuring to hear it from the stormtroopers.</P>   

<P>Within the hour, the Orks again came at us, a lucky shot from their Russ destroying our Basilisk before it had the chance to get a single shot off.  We fought on regardless, like men possessed, and we knew that we were the last line of defense for many miles.  We sold our lives dearly, and made the Orks pay for every inch of ground they took.  But the Orks came at us ignoring the piles of casualties they had taken and entered melee with our boys.  Our boys didn�t stand a chance against the Orks and they fell to the crude Ork swords and axes.  Everywhere our troops were trying to hold out, but the Orks were to strong. Small pockets of resistance fired their guns at the Orks but one by one they were snuffed out.  With burning hatred in our eyes and grim determination on our faces, the few survivors, and I mean the few, radioed High Command to explain our situation and fell back as fast as we could in our remaining Chimeras to our final battleline, 5 miles in the rear.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/mattb_viewscreen.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=LEFT>For the first time in almost a week we could here the nocturnal animals chirping and calling for their mates.  The silence of battle only enraged us more but we knew that Warboss Zigzagga was waiting for a signal by our infiltrators.  The speed freeks sat in their vehicles shaking with anticipation and the opportunity to zoom into combat.  Minutes seemed like hours as the boyz fidgeted with their shootas or sluggas holding out for the warboss to give the green light to attack.</P> 
	
<P>Finally off in the distance we could see a huge explosion of reddish orange flame rise high into the air followed shortly by the deafening sound.  Warboss Zigzagga rose his arm in the air and formed several imaginary circles above his head as his trukk driva revved the engine.  The speed freeks started their engines and jerked forward heading off into the blackness of night.  Ummie shouts and screams began to ring out and the mighty battlecry of the orks almost drowned them out.  Throughout the evening those blasted Space Wolves were no where to be found but we did spot several ummie vehicles casting their spotlights over the battlefield looking for prey.</P> 
	
<P>The speed freeks were being torn to pieces but none of them even noticed their own demise due to the cover of night and the large amount of smoke their vehicles produce.  The boyz on foot were having great luck finding holes in the ummie lines and jumping in the trenches killing guardsmen by the dozen.  The slaverz were also having great success in infiltrating the imperial defenses and engaging his grots into hand-to-hand combat with the ummies.  By early morning the grots had taken a huge pump station and repelled a large band of ummies (it looked like refinery workers).  Warboss Zigzagga was also busy tearing through ummies like a ork possessed.  His 'uge choppa was cutting people into two with one swipe of his blade and his nobz also dispatched several ummies before they even realized they were under attack.</P>  
	
<P>Our deth koptas flew overhead and provided us with a smoke screen while we advanced upon the 'oomie defenders.  The battle was ours for the taking and several ummie squads fell back to our relentless attack.  The speed freeks that punched through the lines kept surging forward without any support from the rest of the Waaagh.  Needless to say we never saw them again but we only hoped that they killed more foul ummies for us.  The only major problem that Warboss Zigzagga brought to our attention was that we needed to drive the imperials from the refinery once more.  Unable to do so we could only hope to destroy as much possible.</P>  
	
<P>Once the sun began to rise and we could see where the enemy was positioned we had a easier time choosing our avenues of advance.  With several dreadnoughts and wartraks targeting ummie vehicles it gave us boyz more room to breath.  Once the enemy big gunz had been destroyed we climbed out of our cover and charged the lightly armoured ummies and began to slaughter them with our close ranged sluggas and unforgiving choppas.  By midday we looked all around us and only found small pockets of resistance but once they realized it was hopeless they surrendered to the nearest ork mob.  Unfortunately for them, they quickly realized that orks never take prisoners and don�t believe in negotiation.  And the ummies think we are stupid.  Victory today seemed final and we all want a opportunity to enter the Hive and see how much havoc we can create in a short amount of time.</P>
