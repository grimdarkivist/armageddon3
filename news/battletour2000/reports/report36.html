<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/imperialretreat.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT>The Orks slowly crept back into starting positions and we called for artillery support but we were denied, they were using it to support an offensive 15 miles away.  We were watching the Orks through our binoculars when we noticed the barrels of lasguns moving towards us.  We were shocked to see them and wondered why the Orks would use them in favor of their own weapons.  Another minute of watching revealed that the lasguns were carried by humans.  They were on the Ork side and marching to the front.  Another minute of close scrutiny proved they were taking up positions against us.  By the Emperor's Grace, we would see them dead and we passed the word down the line that traitors were taking up arms against us and we would make the effort to kill them.</P>

<P>Swirling black clouds of dust and smoke signaled the advance and we steeled ourselves for the inevitable.  We took aim and began firing at the first orks we saw.  Our griffon spouted off in defiance and it's shell landed inside an Ork trukk, blowing it to pieces.  Ork bodies flew in the air and we prepared to shoot those that stood up, but none did.  Praise our griffon crew for dropping well placed rounds amidst the Orks.  Another crack shot sent another mob of Orks to the ground as they looked for cover.  We dropped mortar shells amongst them to terrify and destroy them and they scattered to the winds.</P>

<P>Ork buggies zipped up towards our line awfully quick and they were unscathed by the shots we took at them.  As they drove up, they slowed down and their skorchas leaped forth into a guard squad. The flames licked amongst their cover and their clothing caught on fire.  One guardsmen on fire jumped up and ran screaming away from the fiery inferno only to be driven over by a buggy driver who seemed to revel in the collision.  The other guardsmen in the immolation struggled to put out the flames but it was too much for them and they collapsed where they stood.  The awful smell drifted into our lines making us nauseous and filling us with a greater determination to destroy the Orks.  We brought our heavy bolters to bear on the lead buggy and it flipped over in a gigantic flaming pinwheel, spilling burning fuel in a wide arc, catching some of our men and some orks.  Those lucky enough to not get too much on them put out the fire and went back to fighting.  </P>

<P>We could see the traitors taking pot shots at us and we took it upon ourselves to crush their treachery in melee.  Honors would go to the squads that could take their heads.  All along our line we took it upon ourselves to gain ground and meet these traitors face to face.  As we crept up towards them, we relied on our tanks to keep most of the Orks off our backs.  Carefully sneaking through the ruins of a building, we could see them take up positions and fire at one of our squads in the upper floor of a building.  We followed a tangled mess of twisted metal in an effort to take the traitors from behind in surprise.  As we were creeping along, one of the lads tripped up on a piece of metal causing a heap of metal to come crashing to the ground.  The traitors had spotted us and started tossing grenades at us to pin us down.</P>

<P> We hit the dirt and started firing back as well as tossing grenades.  The traitors charged us and the battle of righteous purification ensued.  The first traitor over the barricade buried his bayonet in the abdomen of Smithy who went down screaming, clutching his stomach. Scooter stepped up with a furious swing of his lasgun and connected, the rifle butt smashing into the traitors head, spewing gore on the charging traitors.  Another traitor tackled Bull and they rolled around on the ground for a few seconds until Bull got his massive hands around the traitors neck to wring the life out of him.  Sarge stepped up with a massive swing of his sword and hacked the arm off a traitor and fired his laspistol into the face of another.  Johnson screamed as he charged with his bayonet leveled at one of the traitors wearing an eye patch.  His screaming gave the traitor a second to step aside and smashed him in the head with a cudgel as he went past.  Johnson collapsed in a heap and the traitor, brandishing his weapon, moved forward to attack Ollie, who was desperately grappling with another traitor.  Ollie was swinging his fist into the kidney of the traitor who was swinging at Ollie's stomach.  Each was struggling for an advantage over the other.  Eye Patch came up and struck Ollie in the back, who dropped to his knees giving the traitor enough time to grab a knife and bury it in Ollie's neck.  Ollie slid to the ground with a look of amazement on his face.</P>

<P>Sarge fired his laspistol into the side of Eye Patch who turned to face Sarge with a look of disgust on his face.  The laspistol seemed to have no effect on Eye Patch and he swung his cudgel, knocking the laspistol from Sarge�s hand.  They looked at each other for a second and slowly started to wheel, testing each other�s defenses.  A quick swipe by Sarge was parried and Eye Patch swung his cudgel and connected with Sarge's shoulder, knocking him sideways.  Sarge regained his balance and stood to face Eye Patch.  Sarge swung again and was parried.  Eye Patch followed the parry with a swift kick to Sarge's leg causing him to stumble. </P>

<P>Meanwhile Bull got up and grappled with Ollie's killer.  The traitor lashed out with his knife at Bull.  Bull grabbed his arm and jerked, pulling the traitor off balance.  In one quick motion, Bull had the traitor in a headlock and squeezed as hard as he could.  The crackling of bones and the sudden limpness of the traitor told Bull that he had crushed the life from the traitor.</P>

<P>Sarge was struggling to hold his own against Eye Patch.   Eye Patch landed a solid blow on Sarge's wrist causing him to shout  and drop his sword.  Sarge backed away, defenseless now and looking for any piece of scrap to defend himself.   Bull saw what was happening and picked the lifeless traitor above his head and threw it at Eye Patch, catching him off guard.  Eye Patch was knocked to the ground and struggled to roll the dead traitor off him.  Bull picked up a steel beam and slammed it down into Eye Patch's face, splitting his skull wide open.  Bull was in a full rage now and looked around for another opponent but the traitors were all on the ground, lifeless and purged.  Bull saw Orks at the other end of the building and took off in a full blown charge, bellowing like a madman.  The rest of the squad rose to their feet and took off in pursuit and support of Bull heading right into the middle of an Ork unit.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/orkywaaagh.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=LEFT>The warbosses were gone for several hours and only the nobz were left to maintain control around the camp.  Within moments the warbosses arrived with small pockets of human 'freedom' fighters.  They mentioned they were loyal to Von Straub and were willing to help us in any manner.  Truthfully, all we needed them for was extra weapons and support.  With our reinforcements secured we started to make our way back to the battlefield hoping to surprise the enemy.  The 'oomies were in the process of securing their defenses and the Speed Freeks rushed in, strafing open bunkers and trench works.  The looted vehicles that managed to operate opened fire on their large hulk tanks.  We noticed several of their vehicles with the emblems of space marines and they were targeted first because of yesterdays debacle.  Land Raiders and Predators of the Black Templars were exploding in wild flames and we noticed marines escaping from their burning transports.  The flanks of the enemy were quickly collapsing and Speed Freeks and dreadnoughts were preventing the enemy from regrouping.  One of the flanks was quickly becoming a burden as the Black Templars were slowly falling back but refusing to give up vital territory.  The losses on both sides were great but we were slowly driving them from the battlefield.  </P> 

<P>The word quickly spread that Warboss Zigzagga needed to take and hold a building on the right flank of the battle and due to the heavy casualties in that area he called the Speed Freeks to assist in this mission.  The fast response of the cult of speed was a awesome sight to behold, but due to the direct approach in their attack they were forced to move diagonally across the battleline.  The 'oomies sighting in on the vehicles were annihilating them as they crossed the ruins.  Proximity mines were self exploding as the Deth Koptas and warbikes zoomed near them and the concussion or shrapnel murdered several of the Orks crewing the vehicles.  Some of the marines and guardsmen rushed forward willing to engage the renegade 'oomies.  Out of trench some female 'oomies donned in power armour and jump packs rushed forward spurting litanies or some jargon and proceeded to cut down the renegade 'oomies without hesitation or remorse.  On the other side of the battlefield a group of mounted 'oomies on horse stormed out of their hiding place and began a long charge towards Von Straubs warriors.  A mob of boyz stepped in front accepting the full charge and counterattacked dragging each of the mounted 'oomies off of their horses and cutting them down with choppas and slugga rounds.  Hiding in the wake of the attack were more 'oomies who caught the orks in crossfire and jumped into melee against the waiting renegade 'oomies.  Blood and body parts flew wildly in the mixed combat and the 'oomies engaged our renegades with more compassion and hatred than we have ever seen.  Von Straub's men that were still able to move commenced a hasty retreat only to be slashed and dealt with from behind.  </P> 

<P>Elsewhere on the battlefield, heavily clad 'oomie women enabled their jump packs and rushed forward attacking another group of renegade guardsmen.  Their pistols were quickly rapid firing and their chainswords whirled as they made contact with Von Straubs guard.  Anguish and pain was forced on the faces of the guardsmen and they were quickly dispatched before any orks could aid in the defense of the battleline.  It almost seemed to us that the 'oomies were more interested in the renegades than what we were doing.  The Black Templars seemed to keep our main force busy and the Speed Freeks were almost completely wiped out by the crossfire of the 'oomie heavy weapons teams and tanks.  The day was hard fought and we decided it would be a better part of valor to fall back and prepare for a fresh offensive.  The weapons fire slowly died down as the enemy faded into the horizon and the 'oomies did not seem willing to follow our retreat.  That will be their undoing and we felt a moral victory because their casualties will not be as easily replaced as ours.  </P>
