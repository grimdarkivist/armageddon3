<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/enthusedimprials.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT><P>The red haze of the morning sun made it difficult for us to target the Orks with any accuracy. The howling mobs came screaming at us and Ork Stormboyz dropped from the skies into the midst of the Space Wolf Terminators and began hacking away madly. One terminator dropped immediately with a choppa lodged in his head, another fell with a few swift chops about the head and shoulders. The sergeant's power sword flickered as it cleaved clean through two Orks. The other terminators' powerfists flickered with a bluish hue as they caved in the skulls of three more orks. The Orks took no notice of the casualties and continued to fight on. They continued with their loud yelling and wild swinging, cleaving in two more of the terminators. Only the sergeant stood as Ork bodies piled up about him, but in the end he was no match to the mass attacks of the Stormboyz. The Stormboyz leapt into the sky and were off in search of new prey.</P>

<P>A strong advance on the left flank caused concern amongst the Space Wolves defending the ruins. A great one lumbered forth in its immense bulk supported by a squad of Grey Hunters.  It was a bastion of strength and firepower and while the machine spirit surged forth inside it, not an Ork was safe. It moved forward, carefully picking its way through the rubble, assault cannon chattering the dance of death across the Ork ranks. Orks fell but still they came on. The great one swept its assault cannon from side to side, hot shell casings clattering amongst the bricks.  Grey Hunters moved forward with the dreadnought, boltguns blazing away at the Orks leaping from cover to cover amidst the smoking ruins. Orks slumped here and there but still the horde came on. The great one turned its assault cannon onto advancing killa kans and blew one apart in a firestorm of shrapnel but another came on. It slammed into the great one and its spinning buzzsaw cut into the plasteel armour and power conduits located on the powerful legs stopping it in its tracks instantly. The great one raised its powerfist and slammed it into the torso of the kan, grabbing a fist of steel and spinning it off within a matter of seconds. The hole revealed a wild-eyed maniacal ork screaming wildly in jibberish. The great one turned his assault cannon into the hole and fired reducing the ork to a pulpy black mess, then pushed the lifeless kan aside to meet a charge by an ork mob. The great one stood as an irresitible force and repulsed the ork attack, firing away madly into the fleeing mob.</P>

<P>Our ogryns were given the order advance and destroy all resistance. In a matter of a few short minutes, they had cleaved through two Ork mobs and had piled into the Ork lootas hiding in a building. The lootas had reduced a Landraider to a charred wreck but they would meet their end at the hands of the Ogryns. The Ogryns tore into the lootas and ripped them limb from limb. The lootas didn't stand a chance and the Ogryns gave them none.</P>

<P>Everywhere our line held strong and the Ork charges were beaten back by blood, sweat, tears, and rifle butts.  Men fought Orks by the dozens and they didn�t yield to the pressure.  The Orks were running out of troops and were beginning to fall back.  We had repulsed them and we would be pushing them out of the city as soon as we could muster our troops.</P>

<P>The sun glistened off of our ork green skin as sweat dripped from our long curved noses.  We leaned against the side of the trench waiting for our bosses to give the signal to rush forward and jump into melee combat. Snorts and growls came from the Orks anxiously anticipating the charge up and over the trench line.  The 'oomies were waiting in their defensive line only a few meters away and we could hear their bosses issuing orders and troops loading their weapons.  Finally, a long loud Waaagh could be heard in the distance as the chant travelled its way down the line.  A tidal wave of green stormed from the trench line and bodies of boyz piled up almost as quickly as they disgorged themselves from their hiding.  Kans and dreadnoughts crushed the skulls of their fallen comrades as they lumbered themselves forward rapidly ejecting casings from their big shootas.  Screams of 'Ere we go' echo from the speed freeks as their accelerators are pushed to floor and the black smoke churns around them.</P> 

<P>The unwavering dedication the boyz had while marching forward shocked the 'oomies as they cut down Ork line after Ork line.  The boyz ability to ignore pain was a huge advantage and hand-to-hand combat became even more deadly when the Orks swathed a path with their huge choppas.  The Stormboyz that were able to control their unreliable jump packs land found themselves surrounded by several different types of heavily armored marines.  The Space Wolves lunged and attacked with their powered fists and chainswords cutting down several Stormboyz almost immediately.  The Stormboyz, unable to notice the death of their comrades because of all the smoke, viciously tore down the Space Wolves with their mighty cutting instruments. </P> 

<P>Meanwhile, the Orks controlling the looted Imperial tanks seemed like 'oomie children on Emperors Day playing with their new toys.  The grinned and smiled greedily at the controls as rounds of battle cannon shells rushed forward occasionally finding a target.  Once in a while the tank would lurch forward or the Ork crew would annihilate a close Ork mob with the tanks heavy bolters.  The loota boyz mimicking a space marine devastator squad snuck into a more forward position steadying their lascannons for a killing blow against some unsuspecting tank.  Just as the lootas finished placing their weapons they looked up to see several Ogryn rushing into the trench tearing into the Orks with their ripper guns. </P> 

<P>The morning looked promising and the casualities the 'oomies were suffering could not be easily replaced.  The vital buildings in the center of the outskirts were ours for the picking, all we needed were a few more boyz and a common rally point.  The reinforcements we received several hours into the battle helped, but by the time they arrived the Imperials rallied around the administorum building and drove us away yet again.  Once again our objective has not been met. We never look at battles as a loss but rather another chance to fight again.  Tomorrow will be another day and we looked forward to driving the Imperials from this planet. </P>
