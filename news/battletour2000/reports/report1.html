<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/aaron_viewscreen.jpg" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Aaron Steibitz" ALIGN=RIGHT>It was a bleak morning but we knew the Orks were near and could hear them revving their engines.  Their Roks had just fallen from the sky and they were gathering for an assault onto Hel's Highway from the North.  Our garrison commander ordered us to set up a battleline with hastily constructed defenses in an attempt to stop the Ork horde. If we failed in our duty to the Emperor, then our families and loved ones would surely suffer the same fate. We were to stem the tide and drive the foul beasts back into the ash wastes. If they were to get past us, then the whole of Helsreach, the refineries, ammo depots, and the factories would soon be in danger. With a great howling and firing of their weapons, the Orks descended upon our positions and we attempt to valiantly hold them off.  Fire flickered from our lasguns as we targeted the greenskins and they fell, but it seemed as if our fire did nothing to their numbers.  Our tanks took a heavy toll on the Orks but their numbers were too great.</P> 
                  
<P>The stormtroopers holding trench 421 were driven out by the mad warbike riders. The Thunderbolt fighter strafing runs failed to find their targets. And to drive the nail in the coffin, the little gretchin swarmed over our beloved commander, Colonel Rudolph Von Broch, and he fell. We know not what happened to him as we began to fall back from the strong pressure of the Ork horde towards the edge of the refineries. It was there that we would make another prepared stand and call in reinforcements.</P>

<p>The Orks seem to be driven with purpose and their scouts have been spotted looking for routes into the refinery district.  Our battlelines were bolstered by the arrival of the Space Wolves.  Seeing them in their resplendent grey armour gave our soldiers the boost of determination to repulse the Orks that we so desperately needed.  As the Orks assembled on the horizon, we jumped at the chance to destroy them.  The refinery workers sprung forth from underground tunnels to surge into the Orks and kill them by the dozens.  Though none of them survived, their valor shall be noted so that all may know they have the strength to repel these foul invaders.  The guns of the Space Wolves flashed and the Orks fell in droves. Few of them reached our lines and those that did were quickly dispatched.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/jack_viewscreen.jpg" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Jack Ramsey" ALIGN=LEFT>The boyz were loading and pulling their weapons when the thunderous impact of the Roks hit the Armageddon landscape.  Port holes and bulkheads opened and a flood of Orks littered the ash wastes.  Warboss Grim Zog Skulkrusha and his Nob retinue sat anxiously anticipating battle in their wartrukk as the vehicle roared out through a large opening in the Rok.  Quickly to follow was the rush of Speed Freeks revving their engines and wildly firing weapons as clouds of black smoke start to envelope the bikers.  Strict orders were sent from Ghazkull Thraka to take the refinery that was just over the horizon.  The refinery was located near a large highway and held resources to keep the speed freeks mobile and happy.</P> 

<P>Within moments of deploying the Waaagh, fire from recently spotted trenches began to tear through the ranks and orks dropped by the dozen. The green tide pushed forward while the bikers and Deth Koptas roared ahead pouring huge shoota shells into the trenches. The more heavily armed boyz, dreadnoughts and killa kans targeted vehicles so the speed freeks could dominate the battlefield with their quickness. Several ommie vehicles were destroyed but not before one fired and destroyed our beloved warboss's wartrukk. Most orks seeing our warboss dead were having second thoughts about continuing the attack and the ommie planes dropping bombs on our battleline furthered the cause. But then we witnessed a great victory that pushed us forward to drive the ommies from their defenses. Our grotz actually survived all the firefights and reached the enemy entrenchment destroying their headquarters and driving the ommie commander from the battlefield.  We continued to drive forward and we finally reached the outskirts of the refinery.</P>

<P>We quickly regrouped and more orks from other rok sites arrived to offer their assistance. Then out of the smoke and the rubble of previous fighting came Warboss Grim Zog Skulkrusha and a few of his nobz. He suffered minor injuries and he quickly acquisitioned another wartrukk by kicking some trukk boyz out of the vehicle. A loud Waaagh roared through our forces and we surged forward to take our objective. Waiting patiently for us were heavily armored grey troops that we recognized from centuries of warfare. Space Wolves,  the finest warriors ommies can make. Warboss Skulkrusha has several personal grudges with the Space Wolves and suddenly the battle became a one ork crusade. We no longer wanted to take the refinery, we wanted to kill all grey armoured ommies. Some orks drove towards the refinery without support and communication within our Waaagh broke down. The separation in our forces made us easy prey for the ommies and we were forced to fall back so we could fight again on another day. As far as Warboss Grim Zog Skulkrusha was concerned, he was consumed by his own hatred and the grey armored ommies ended his grudge. WAAAGH!!!!!!!!!  </P>
