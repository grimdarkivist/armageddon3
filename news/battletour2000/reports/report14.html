The feelings of what has happened to our commander are split between the troops. If the need for manpower was not so great there is no doubt that we would not be alive this day. I have been given a field commission over the Steel Legion forces in this sector. The revolution of those little pests continues but after what has happened to the past commander I am unsure as to what action to take, if any. I have told my men to fire on them if they see them as a threat and that situation has arose a few times. If they in turn try to fire upon us they will feel the full might of the Emperor's armies but for now I shall let them die for our cause.</P>

<P>To top off the split feelings of my troops, some of them are falling to the rehertic of that damned Von Strab. In fact, there is word that he would send troops to show his support of the Orks in the upcoming battles, only time will tell...</P>

<P>The Orks took the field and tried to overwhelm the bastion of hope that is the Cathedral. It has stood for all of the wars of Armageddon and has proved to be a valuable part of morale for our forces. I have received reports of some humans fighting alongside of the Greenskins, they may be Von Strab's men but there is nothing that can confirm this. The Orks made countless advances on the Cathedral but were stopped at every turn. The highlight of the day came when two squads of Adeptus Arbites emerged from the chapel to shoot and then wipe out a squad of Mega Armored Orks in hand to hand. This is just one of the many unsung acts of valor that have taken part on this field.</P> 

<P>One of the mortar shells deviated and hit the Grots that were engaged in hand to hand with a mob of Orks. The corporal said it was not intentional, but intentional or not the little traitors opened up on everyone, human and Ork. Then they vanished into the ruins of the city only to show up assaulting one of my Basilisks. The Salamanders came in at the end of the battle to dispatch the humans that were allying with the Orks, the rumor still stands that the Terminator sergeant dispatched Von Straub himself but this report cannot be verified.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/kylelaundry.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=LEFT>We wuz reel sad ta hear what happened to da Boss Azgardian. But da revolution must continue. Dis day will show how da oomies treated uz, just as bad as da Orks. So after taking over one of dere Shoota tanks it will be know az Bazilisk Day...</P>

<P>Skabb - Grot Revolutionary</P> 

<P>Doze Grotz is gettin' on my nerves, they are dividing up into two wayz of livin' dose dat do what dey iz told and dose dat get a boot in da bum. Da oomies in da other side don't care none about da Grotz and even dey are shootin' at dem lotz. We iz gonna go and bang some heads wiv dem boyz some more 'cause as much as we stomp 'em day keep comin' back for more, just like a grot. Maybe if we paints dem to look like Grotz we could get rid of da trouble makin' grotz and use some of da green oomies.</P> 

<P>One of da bosses told me not to fire at da spikey oomie tanks dat waz going to be comin' up da far road. He said dat dey waz gonna help uz. I don't trust oomies all dat much but dey did ok for oomies until dem marines came and chopped 'em up. We took most of da road but it all fell apart when our oomies died and dere waz nothing protecting our sides. We iz gonna take dat fancy building down, it iz just a matta of time.</P>
