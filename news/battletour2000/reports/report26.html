<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/maniacorkdude.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT>Reports began to arrive from our listening posts that a horde of Orks were heading towards us with a large contingent of speed freaks and some looted tanks. They were obviously heading for bridge Samus. We however, were charged to stop them. We deployed in trenches and redoubts that were created for this purpose and feared the worst. </P>

<P>As the dawn cleared we beheld the green horde charging toward us. Salvoes of rockets and a hail of heavy weapon fire met our battle cannon and mortar barrages. They drove the smaller 'Grots' ahead of the mobs of boyz so that these Grots were the first to reach the Imperial lines. Hand-to-hand ensued between the guardsmen holding the trenches and the viscious Grots. The sheer number of the Grots prevailed and the guardsmen withdrew to other trenches. Seeing the center in danger of collapsng, our commander ordered his reserves of Ogryns into the fray. </P>

<P>These huge simians deployed from a speeding chimera and immediately started to crush Orks with their huge weapons or even with their bare hands. As this was transpiring, a group of Speed Freeks, no doubt attracted by the sounds of battle, roared onto the field. The Mordian Iron Guard held the left flank in a grip of steel by might of their arms and their unshakable faith in the Emperor. Indeed, only an hour after dawn they had completely decimated the Orks in front of their positions while their tanks were firing to support our positions. From reports later on I learned that while we were desperately fighting for our lives the Iron Guard were sitting down eating ration packets!</P>

<P>Even with the Ogryns in the center our lines were in danger of breaking until reinforcements arrived in the form of a gray painted Land Raider carrying Space Wolf Terminators. The ferocity with which they flung themselves into the fray was almost as heartening as the way their storm bolters and power fists tore huge chunks out of the Ork mobs. On the heels of the Land Raider a Rhino also sped onto the field deploying a squad of Space Wolves. With the added firepower of their bolters and the lasguns wielded by the remaining guardsmen the center was firmly held. Unfortunately on the right the Ork hordes had overwhelmed our brethren in combat and were streaming across the no mans land towards the center of our line. Some were also making their way off the field, no doubt in response to orders from their diabolical leader.</P>

<P>We learned from our Space Wolf reinforcements that the main horde of the Orks was yet to arrive and that our place in the lines was to be taken by Space Wolf marines that were arriving onto the battlefield. The only guard to remain were the Iron Guard who had held their lines and had even advanced into the former Ork positions across the battlefield. I cannot report what actually happened as my squad had boarded our Chimera but I can relate what was told by the Mordians later.</P>

<P>Apparently a large Speed Freek horde had roared into the battle and succeeded in reaching the Guard lines. Only after a long and difficult combat were the Ork Warbikes and Trukks driven back. Both sides inflicted heavy causalities but the Iron Guard refused to break and the greater number of guardsmen began to tell. Elsewhere in the battle the Space Wolves were living up to their ferocious reputation and their Long Fangs destroyed Ork vehicle after vehicle.</P>

<P>Desperate to regain the ground lost by the guard the Space Wolves advanced into a hail of small arms fire and replied with bolter volleys of their own. Misfortune befell them as salvoes and salvoes of ork rockets began to fall among their vehicles. Disabled and crippled the armored might of the Space Wolves was slowly crushed except for the 'Ravening Maw'. The armored bulk of this Land Raider shrugged off the blast of rocket after rocket to move forward and deliver the Wolf Guard into the Ork lines. Despite this heroic effort, by the time the Space Marines withdrew, the Orks still held the ground they had taken. It was our commanders hope that they would not have the impetuousness to launch another attack but that hope was to prove in vain in the coming days.</P>
