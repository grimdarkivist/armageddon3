<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/Ryan.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Ryan Phelps - Grot Rebel" ALIGN=LEFT>The Orks came at our lines before dawn today. We are running low on everything from rations to ammo but for some reason night vision goggles were airlifted to our sector this week. Regardless of the sector quartermaster's error we had them and used them to our advantage. The Greenskin revolution is still tearing my men into disarray and I have no one to turn to. My Commissars have all been KIA and the Marines will not tolerate what they view as weakness.</P>

<P>The Orks are throwing everything they have at us. They have even started to load their ranshackle Trukk troop carriers with explosives and are making suicide runs into our lines. As expected the Space Marines are truly bravery incarnate. Today a lone Dark Angel who lost his squad to a hail of Ork guns charged a regiment of Mega Armored Orks without a second thought. He held on longer than I thought was humanly possible and then fell to the massed power claw attacks by the burly Greenskins.</P>

<P>Some of my Lieutenants have come over the comm and requested permission to join the Revolutionary Grots. I have repeatedly told them not to separate the smaller greenskins from the larger ones and not  to commit the heresy of sympathizing with the revolutionary cause. If it is green it must be shot! Perhaps these alien scum are using mind-altering chemicals which are getting past our respirators? Although the Grot revolution has gained popular cause among our beleagured rank and file troops, such an alliance must not even be considered. If only my Commissars were still here to instill discipline in the trenches...</P>

<P ALIGN=RIGHT><I> - Acting Captain Foley, XXX Armageddon Steel Legion</I></P>

<P>There was a report by one of our tactical squads that the association with the alien scum has continued and we have dispatched more Ravenwing squads to deal with the situation. After our incident in the previous battle we have left some influence on many squads in both the Asgardian and the Steel Legion forces. These guardsmen will no doubt do what is right when the time of judgment is at hand. These words will have to prove themselves true because of the actions, or lack there of, of the Imperial commander. He did ask for our assistance but our mission is not to order his men but to follow our the will of the Emperor, to purge the enemy. The Guard Captain fell to a Battle Cannon shot that rang out from the center of the Imperial lines. We may have to request a leader to step up and take control of the Imperial forces but I do not know if there are any command staff on planet (other than Yarrick himself) who could bring these weaklings back into the light of the Emperor's Grace.</P>

<P>Da Ork boyz started out wiv all da boyz dey could musta' but it did not matta much. Da Big Boss waz smashed early on and it went downhill from dere. Dey had a few good ideas, considerin' dey is only Orks, dey loaded up da empty trukks wiv ammo and extra gas and drove dem into da 'oomies. Dey tried to jump out before dey made da boom but a lot of 'em did not make it clear. Da Orks waz glad ta see uz good grotz arrive on da field but we had ta teach doze revolution grotz a lesson and we waz just da boyz ta do it. Da Orks took a massive beatin' today and dey still could not get close ta da fancy buildin' but wiv uz dere ta help 'em we will get to it soon. "Down with the Revolusion!!!"
