<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/scottabbottviewscreen.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=RIGHT>The Orks came at us as they never have before. They were filled with a vengeance, the likes of which I have never seen.  The Black Templars fought bravely and gave their lives dearly but they couldn't stop the green tide.  The slaughter was terrible and it seemed as if the Orks were possessed they fought so hard.  During the battle, our command spotted a very disturbing sight.  Human beings were fighting on the side of the Orks and we attempted to deliver a fatal blow to them but failed.  Traitors, you shall know the Emperor's fury and you shall be purged!  Seeing these Traitors fighting for the Orks, when we had given our all and our lives so that Hive Helsreach might survive, filled us with unspeakable anger and we vowed to destroy them all or die trying.  The Orks pushed us out of the refinery and we fell back to the outer reaches of Hives Helsreach.</P>

<P>Upon hearing that some Traitors were mobilized against our forces, High Marshall Wiertalla of Adeptus Arbites Precinct I-75/94, called his Arbites together with prisoners given the option of fighting or death.  Most prisoners welcomed the chance to fight for the Emperor as it was their last hope for freedom.  One prisoner squad met a cruel fate as it was attacked by the Ork kans leaving only snipets of orange cloth and flesh behind.  There were to be few survivors this day.  The Suppression squads quickly moved towards the Traitors to administer the Emperor�s justice.  They had been judged and their fate was sealed.   The Arbites advanced into the center and were supported on the flank by a contingent of Space Wolves.  It would turn out to be a vicious night battle and many of our number would fall but we were able to hold the line and drive the Orks back.</P>

<P>A Space Wolf contingent arrived and the tide of battle began to swing as night fell once again.  The Space Wolves, upon spotting the Traitors, fell upon the Orks and hacked their way through them in an effort to reach the Traitor scum.  Once the Space Wolves reached the Traitors, we knew there would be no survivors.  The Traitors didn�t slow the Wolves down, as they were cut down with ease, and moved towards more Orks.  Now we�ll push these Orks from the city and wipe them out.</P>

<P>With our ork forces inside the refinery complex victory was only a matter of time.  Ghazkull will now know how good a commander Griz Mag Zigzagga really is.  Roks were constantly dropping from orbit and the mighty Waaagh only grows stronger when our enemy thinks we are weakening.  Boyz, trukks, kans and bikes were rapidly reaching the refinery and quickly launching headlong into another assault.  Within hours the entire complex was under ork control and the fuel began to be taken back to more secure areas.  Several ork boyz stayed behind to collect the fuel while the rest of the ork Waaagh surged forward through the ash wastes in hot pursuit after the retreating guard and marines.</P>
 
<P>By dusk, the orks had reached the outskirts of Hive Helsreach and were confronted with waiting Space Wolves and guardsmen.  Along the way though, the orks picked up several guardsmen willing to fight and assist the ork war effort.  Many believed they stood a better chance of surviving, fighting for the orks than for the emperor.  The local proctor was informed of the situation and he ordered all of his arbites to the battlefield to purge the heretics and make examples of them all.  A long and bloody street fight ensued and the 'ommies were better prepared for urban combat than we expected.  Once again the space wolves, aided by nightfall, fought with excellent precision and timing.  The orks took heavy casualities throughout the night and when the sun started to light the sky they found themselves no further along the highway than they were hours ago.  The refinery was a major victory due to the vast amount of supplies we stole, but it was not going to help destroy the planet.  The ommie hives must be destroyed at all costs and the orks will continue to probe for weaknesses until one or several are found!</P>
