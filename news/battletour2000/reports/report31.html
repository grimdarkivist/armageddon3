<P>Evening drew near and still the orks came at us. Our only hope was to devastate them quick and fast. The Orks brought up their Russ tanks and we fired what we had at them but to no avail. The Orks were getting smarter and placed their vehicles in some buildings which would prove very difficult to destroy.  The Russ fired away indiscriminately and caught man and machine in its blast.  Guardsmen fell by the dozens but still we fought on. The Russ found a Space Wolf Predator Annihilator and fired a shell at it. The shell penetrated the thick plasteel detonating the engine, sending the turret spinning off into the distance.</P>

<P>A Space Wolf Landraider clanked up towards the massive battleline crushing buildings and Orks in its path.  Its slow methodical process betrayed the awesome firepower it held.  It picked its targets and fired until they were destroyed and then found another and proceeded to eliminate it.  It carried on this way for quite some time until it came across the Ork Russ. The instant that it was recognized as an enemy target, the Landraider fired continuously at it. The building began to crumble around the Russ as the pillars and foundation were destroyed. The Russ was well placed but the Landraider blew holes in the building big enough for Ogryns to climb through and it wasn�t long before the lascannon shots started hitting the Russ.  Liquid steel was running off the front of the tank and it appeared that the turret was fused to the hull. A few more shots and it was a charred hull slowly burning away inside a ruined building.</P>  

<P>The Grey Hunters zipped towards the enemy lines in their Razorback supported by more marines in a Rhino and a half-dozen guard squads.  They unloaded and piled into an ork mob.  A vicious combat ensued but the savage fury of the Orks was not enough for the vengeful Space Wolves. As the last of the Orks were being cut down, Ork killa kans and Imperial Guardsmen entered the fray. A bloodbath ensued and the Space Wolves and Guardsmen lost many men before the kans were disabled and destroyed.</P> 

<P>Elsewhere, small squads of Guardsmen with heavy tank support continued to hold out against the Orks. The Orks were thick in some areas but not like they had been a few days before. They might not have been able to marshall their forces together in one mass battle but they still proved to be a difficult foe. The Orks fought on and in places they breached the Imperial line only to face a reserve Hellhound or Armoured Fist squad bent on closing any gaps that might open up.  On the whole of the battleline, the Orks were being pushed back and destroyed!</P>

<P>Night fell and it got increasingly hard to see our enemy. We knew the positions they were in but it didn�t make our advance any easier. Warboss Zigzagga thought the best attack was a forward advance while sending everything at 'em all at once. Explosions rang out and lasguns found their marks as Orks fell for the greater glory of the Waaagh. The most confusing issue we had to deal with during the night fight was that we quickly found deadly new enemies. Every evening the marines known as the Space Wolves would arrive and help garrison the ruins and the outskirts of the 'oomie hive. Their senses are more acute at night than any ork I have ever seen. They are finding our weak points and hitting them very hard with everything they got.</P>

 <P>We attempted to drive right down the middle and found serious 'oomie resistance. The Space Wolves were just waiting on our flank and when we committed ourselves to combat in the buildings they pounced. We were quickly driven from the ruins and back out into the ash wastes. Our speed freeks tried to prevent any Imperial advance but their fast flame throwing tank caught several boyz and scorched them alive with burning fuel. The stormboyz jumped forward and engaged marines in fierce combat only to be cut down as the 'oomies rushed forward.</P>

<P>Warboss Zigzagga sent several Trukk boy mobs forward and he even gathered up some nobz to join his boyz in the fight. Zigzagga kept several 'oomie units from advancing because after melee they were no longer left alive. The Trukk boyz were eventually caught in a horrible cross fire and Warboss Zigzagga fell back after losing over half of his faithful nobz. The evening went poorly for our advance and we have also noticed that Warlord Legsnappa has been unable to reprimand Zigzagga for his poor leadership. The Waaagh has been going poorly throughout the planet and we only hope to die in battle and not by the hands of our warboss.</P>
