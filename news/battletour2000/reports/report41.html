<P>We'd pushed the Orks back to the edge of the hive but they were putting up a strong resistance.   A well placed Zzap truck was hidden amongst some debris and had a scorched mattress thrown over top it.  As the Templar's Crusader crushed rocks and debris under its heavy tracks while it advanced through the ruins, the mattress was flung back, and the Gretchin took aim at the massive bulk of the Landraider.  The static energy from the powering Zzap gun raised dust particles from the ground.  A white hot bolt of energy shot forth impacting into the front of the Landraider, blasting a gaping hole in the thick armour and causing the Landraider to stop.  Everyone watched as the Landraider exploded, sending red hot fragments of metal into the air.  It gave the Orks something to cheer for and they came at us recklessly. </P>

<P>The Ork bikers hit the Black Templar defensive line in the trenches to our left.  Neither side would break from combat and more Templars piled into the combat to eliminate the bikes.  A few brief seconds saw the end of the bikes and the Templars returned to their trenches to await the rest of the Ork advance.  Their devastating fire took a heavy toll on the Orks who were forced to slip back into the ruins.</P>  

<P>Our right side was being furiously pounded by the Orks.  Stormboyz came swooping out of the sun and hammered one of our squads.  We fired into them but they took no notice of the casualties and swept into another unit.  Bikes and wartraks came up in quick support and fired deadly volleys into our ranks.  Guardsmen were cut down where they stood.  Our guns rang out in defiance but the Orks proved to be too strong.  Their guns blazed away at us and they shot us out of the ruins we were using for cover.  </P>

<P>We fought on but we couldn't stop the Ork advance.  There were too many of them and we were down to our last supplies and ammunition.   We carefully fell back and gave supporting fire to each other and made the Orks pay for every inch that they gained.</P>

<BR CLEAR>

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/waaaghguy.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT>We knew the Waagh was ending and its energy was slowly lapsing, leaving thousands of Orks in its wake.  Warboss Zigzagga, reluctant to give up ground or leave the planet without total mass destruction, spurred the boyz on to charge straight forward in the middle of the enemies battleline.  The flashes from the imperial guards lasguns and the thumping of the larger ordnance weapons tore through our lines with vicious ferocity.  The bellowing from the orks left running absorbed any other noise created on the battlefield and we could tell that the yelling and shear anger in our eyes made the 'oomies quake with fear and regret that they were ordered to defend the ruins at all costs.</P>

<P>The Trukk boyz waved their choppas over their heads and randomly snapped off slugga shots as Trukks raced forward with the Ork drivers grinning from ear to ear.  The Speed Freeks wasted no time and all their vehicles were dabbed with red paint to ensure that the boyz were guaranteed engagement.  Following closely were the Deth Koptas and the Stormboyz jumping from cover to cover until the enemy was distracted, and then they would pounce into hand-to-hand combat little a stalking wild cat.</P>  

<P>The ground began to shake and the rocks and pebbles clattered together as on the other side of the ruins discovered the culprit.  A Black Templars Land Raider Crusader came into full view supported by a predator tank and a small detachment of marines.  I blinked my eyes and was startled to see the Land Raider a burning hulk when my eyes opened.  Several marines clamored out of the tank and the Zzap gun positioned on a Trukk took aim once again and sent shrapnel sprawling as it found its mark once again on the predator.  The Stormboyz noticed the disorientated marines slowly regrouping around the burning hulks and they quickly jumped into combat taking advantage of the situation.  Their choppas quickly disposing of a few marines the black templars quickly counter-attacked and fought valiantly until their last man.  The opposite end of the battlefield quickly collapsed without the support of the marines and the lack of mobility.</P> 

<P>The Speed Freeks swarmed around the guardsmen and tortured them so no 'oomie was killed to quickly.  Most were left limbless on the battlefield to either die of shock or blood loss and the crews of the tanks attempted to run noticing that even their armored hulls could not protect them from the inevitable.  The 'oomies fell back in disorganized groups while the Speed Freeks destroyed anything they caught.  Gork and Mork smiled down on us today and it was a great victory, now on to Hive Helsreach and the destruction of the planet.</P>
