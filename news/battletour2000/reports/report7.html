<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/4tankcommandersviewscreen.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=RIGHT>Thought of the day: Utterly destroy the foe, let not one of them survive, nor their presence be felt. Pursue them to the ends of the earth and be ever vigilant.</P>

<P>The remaining Ork pockets in the outer reaches of the hive were quickly routed. It had been a close battle but we had held.  Let the cleansing flame of the Emperor wipe the foul stain of the alien presence from our world.  The Orks were pursued into the ash wastes by the Black Templars and the Space Wolves with the hopes of wiping them out for good. The Adeptus Astartes reached the vanguard of the Orks and engaged them.  The Orks came at them from all directions and the marines moved to engage them.  An Ork squad swarmed over the Wolf Guard holding a trench but to no avail.  Their armour was too strong and their weapons too deadly.  The Orks were driven back but they had lost their impetus.</P>  

<P>The Templars bore a large brunt of the fighting and those lacking in faith quickly fell during this terrible time.  One Deth Kopta squadron managed to destroy four Templars in one strafing run.  Templars fell in droves as they tried to withstand the ferocious Ork attacks and failed. Templars perished by the dozens. As fast as the marines could destroy the Orks more arrived to join the fray.  Wave upon wave of the yelling greenskins advanced upon the stalwart marines, yet they did not yield.  Instead they advanced upon the foe, firing as they went, and continued to take precious ground from the Orks.  Templars arriving via Drop Pods were the final nail in the coffin for the Ork assault as they had no time to react to the arrival of these reinforcements. The surviving Orks were dispatched from the battlefield.</P>

<P>The Space Wolves and Black Templars attacked the refinery from a different flank with the hopes of recapturing it.  Many Orks were defending it from capture and an epic battle for survival ensued.  An Ork battlefortress, four times the size of a Landraider, advanced upon the Marines.  They fired everything they had at it only to see chunks of metal and scrap blown off it.  The battlefortress continued to drive upon the Marines, impervious to the firing.  Its great cannon belched out noise, smoke, and flame and a great gout of earth exploded behind the Landraider.</P>  

<P>The Orks pressed forward into the Marines and the brave defenders of the Imperium surged forward into the Orks. The Templars exacted a terrible toll on the Orks in revenge for the previous battle.  No Orks survived this day against the Templars as they secured one of the oil storage tanks from the greenskin menace.</P>  

<P>Lascannon fire continued to lash out at the battlefortress, first destroying one of its drivetracks slowing it down then another destroying its deathroller bring it to a jolting stop.  Orks flew off the top of it and after picking themselves off the ground, hurled themselves at the marines, only to be cut down by well aimed bolter fire.  The Space Wolves advance stalled and they fought for their survival against the Orks and were unable to capture any of the oil storage tanks.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/mattnicklesviewscreen.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=LEFT>We felt demoralized and broken. Our speed freeks were slowly driving through the ash wastes when we saw and heard a huge explosion towards the back line of our boyz.  The 'oomies followed us throughout our fall back and waited until our guard was down.  The Black Death (Black Templars) and the grey armoured wolves assisted each other in this unexpected counter assault and it threw us into disarray and confusion.</P>

<P>Griz Mag Zigzagga looked flabbergasted at the current condition of his boyz but the mere nod of his head cleared his mind of all confusion.  He began barking orders and slapping boyz around until orky order was restored.  By this time the heavily armoured ummies had torn through our ranks and destroyed the vast majority of our speed freek vehicles and bikes.  The only way Warboss Zigzagga knew how to fix this disaster was to call up more boyz and freeks.  Wave after wave of orks hit the frontline of fighting and they were quickly destroyed or disbanded.  Our force was in numbers and our reinforcements were not arriving all at once so hundreds of orks were dying without making any progress.  The current lack of leadership began to be noticed by the overall warboss of this region, Warboss Ragnatz Legsnappa.  He has been overseeing all battles in and around Hive Helsreach and because of the vital importance to hold the refinery he ordered his battle fortress to investigate the battle at the refinery.</P>

<P>Warboss Legsnappa arrived just in time to offer assistance in defense of the refinery.  The 'oomie marines had pushed us to the fringe of the complex and were attempting to take back the fuel depots and control stations.  Because of Warboss Legsnappas quick decisions and cunningly brutal tactics we held the complex and kept the ummies from winning back the fuel.</P>

<P>Immediately after combat the two warlords met and Warboss Legsnappa made it clear that if he had to come back and repel the marines once more then Warboss Zigzagga would not be alive to talk about the emminent great ork victory. He now hungers for a chance to prove himself. We had won the day but barely. The good thing is we never lose, we just live to fight another day. We just gotta make it to the hive and crush some more 'oomies before Ghazghkull shows up.</P>
