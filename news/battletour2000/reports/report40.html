<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/jestersbeatdown.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT>The final push for the Cathedral began early in the morning as the sun rose beyond the Cathedral spires. Orks filled the battlefield. Charging across the bodies of the dead and the blasted hulks of broken machines, they ripped their way into the Imperial lines. These were the last of the reserved South of Helsreach. They had survived the previous month's fighting and had grown larger, stronger, and more powerful. Now there was no way back. They must get through or die.</P>

<P>Guns pounded their lines strewing body parts in their wake. Still the hoardes came on. Salamanders dropped in from orbit to stop the onslaught. Still they came on. Sisters of Battle held the heights as Basilisk fire rained down on the Orks. Still they came on. Finally, with the Valhallans broken before them, the Ork Speed Freak units broke through and continued north to Helsreach. The remaining Orks prepared to silence the guns on the Cathedral Hill when Imperial reinforcements arrived from the West.</P>

<P>In the past, the Steel Legion's Chimera speed had saved the day. Driving forward they had been able to break the Ork lines, their multi-lasers slashing through the lightly armed Ork vehicles. This time the Orks were ready.  </P>

<P>In a brilliant move, the Ork Warboss Grimminthrak divided his forces sending a small contingent west to hold back the Steel Legion while the bulk of his forces were sent towards the Cathedral to the East. If he could slow the Steel Legion, he reasoned rather quickly for an Ork, he could capture the Cathedral and silence the devastating guns. Besides, it would be a great way to maim and kill. </P>

<P>Over the next few hours the Orks slogged their way toward the Cathedral. Their advance was slowed by the sacrifice of the Sisters of Battle who's Immolators and Seraphim were sent forward and destroyed several key Ork mobile units. The Orks moved forward however, and as time wore on fewer and fewer men were left to defend the Cathedral from the green hoard. In the west, large mobs of Ork boyz waited in ambush for the Steel Legion. They sprang from cover and their rokkit launchas blazed away destroying or immobilizing vehicle after vehicle. The Imperial advance stalled in short order and the Orks advanced into hand to hand combat.</P>

<P>By the end of the day the Imperial presence on the field was all but gone. True, they still held the temple, but only a handful of Guardsmen remained to protect the one remaining Basilisk. In the west, both the Steel Legion and the Orks had fought to a stand still and few survivors remained. Despite the carnage, the green skins held most of the field of battle and would quickly overwhelm the remaining defenders. Red blood flowed over the field and the Orks Waaghed in triumph!</P>
