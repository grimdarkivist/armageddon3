<P>After a week of setting our trap the Orks finally rose to the bate and bit, praise the Emperor. We had two platoons of Valhallans guarding the road up from the sea, while a small force of Sisters guarded the church. The High Command's plan was simple: let the orks think their way into Helsreach from the South was only lightly defended. Once the green skinned scum charged our positions, reinforcements would arrive and smash them from both sides closing the jaws of the trap. Despite heavy losses, the morning engagement went as planned. The Orks drove forward to our positions and sent a small force towards the Temple on our left flank. We hit them with everything we had and were able to destroy the forces sent against the temple. The center did not fair so well. The loss of Colonel Ormond and Commissar Norquest was a heavy blow to Imperial moral and the Orks occupied all of the ground that the Valhallans had held earlier in the day. Then the real counter attack began. </P>

<P>Eight Chimeras of the Steel Legion sweeped in from the right while more Valhallans and Sisters poured froth from the cathedral to take up prepared positions on the left. The green skins put up a fight, stalling the Steel Legion advance, but taking heavy losses in return. On the right the orcs advanced towards the cathedral, but many of their mobile units were destroyed. As night neared the Imperial command bunker, now in ork possession was only lightly defended. Seeing his advantage General Dittman III sent in his reserves of Salamanders and a flight of Seraphim, which took back the Imperial command bunker. With the bunker again in our possession, the automated defense bunkers could be brought on line and short work was make of the orcs. The few orc survivors fled under the cover of darkness.</P>

<P>OK, der wuz only a few 'oomies between the docks and the big hive. Warboss Kilgron say take it, an' we go. Lots of boyz. Lots of trukks. Didn't give no bike nor Death Kopptas so we took fire the whole way. Not dat we care! We big boyz. Some of us go to temple. We crush the hummies there and hack the funny 'oomie women in the shells. Don't take a lot of fire. Den the big tank comes out of the temple and the Ladies come down from da sky. Big fire drive us back down the hill. Lots of shoota fire from the ladies. We don't do so well there. In the center we make real progress. Crush lots of 'oomies. Take their big red bunker and have big party in it. Warboss happy.</P>

<P>Den  t'ings start to go bad. We get some Speed Freaks up to help, but lots of 'oomies start coming in from all sides. Warboss says go forward, so we go taking the 'oomie ammo with us. Crush the 'oomie tanks on the left, then kill the weak 'oomies with our choppas. Red blood flows faster! Boyz on that side have nice time. Boyz on other side not have nice time. Warboss gets hit by big big gun and dies. Death Koptas kill lots of 'oomies, but dey break our trukks. Can't get near nough to 'em. Den more ladies and Green Marines out of the sky. Dey behind us and take der bunker back. Then big guns start firing at us. Not fun. Lots of boyz die. Hey, I wonder if da hummies planned it from the beginning? Nah, hummies not that bright.</P>
