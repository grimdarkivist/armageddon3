<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/rickwebb.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=RIGHT>The Orks attacked us again in the morning.  Most city residents were fleeing the carnage and attempting some kind of escape.  Some residents picked up tools and pistols and were ready to fight back the invaders. Those crazed individuals were ready to give their lives for their homes and there was no way we were going to drive them from the field.</P>  

<P>The Orks came at us and we fought back with everything we had.  The Black Templars were spread out on a wide front and their Terminators charged into the center of the Ork horde to eliminate their warboss and bodyguard.  It was a fantastic sight to watch as the blue energy field of the powerfist crackled to life and spread across the armour of the orks, smashing them to paste and spreading black blood and armour plates in a wide arc.  The Orks fought back with their crude power instruments, crushing through Terminator armour with ease causing blood and ceramite to spew forth.  In an instant, neither side was standing and all that was left were lifeless husks in broken armour.</P>  

<P>The rest of the Templars saw this carnage and charged forward into the center of the enemy. They fought with a determination that filled us with a resolve that we had not known before. The Templars pushed into the center of the Ork horde and destroyed everything they could. The Orks were vanquished from the center and all they could rely on was their strong flanks.</P> 

<P>Gretchin were swarming towards us and we had to destroy as many as we could before they got too close.   We fired like mad at the squad in front of us, but were overwhelmed in a matter of brutal seconds.  The Gretchin continued to advance but our fire was too much and they disappeared into whatever cover they could find.  We didn't see them again as we turned our attention towards helping our fellow guardsmen send the Orks back to the ash wastes

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/grotsofdoom.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=LEFT>Hive Helsreach was within our grasp and the closer we came to the megapolis, the more ruined buildings and leveled skyscrapers we had to fight through.  It was a difficult task to inspect all of the rooms and passageways that still littered the battlefield but Warboss Zigzagga was adamant about us boyz making sure no one was left behind us.  Small pockets of resistance turned into defensive positions and strongholds and the umies were left there for one reason and one reason only. There main goal was to stall our advance and wait until those cursed Black Templar Marines arrived.</P>

<P>Suddenly large spheres of blackness formed in mid-air and lightning began to crackle around the phenomenon when black armoured Terminators appeared out of nowhere and began killing boyz with their powerful fists and short ranged shootas.  Trukk boyz leapt from their vehicles and swarmed the Terminators and within moments the mighty choppas wiped the Black Templars out. Watching their most honored warriors die horribly, the Black Templars fought with more determination and vengeance than ever before.  The other umies also began to rally around the vigor of the marines and it even seemed to us that umies not bred for fighting started to pick up various weapons and tools to join in the struggle.  Boyz began to realize that today's offensive was nearly over and that we needed severe reinforcements from other Waaaghs more fortunate than us. Once the army began to pull back to regroup we watched the comical end to several mobs of our grots.  They were lead by very resourceful and 'ard slavers and the last we saw any of them was when they jumped into some enemy trenches. Moments later oomie banners and flags were waving in the air taunting us to engage them once more. Our nobs and bosses took the oomie cheering as personal insults and raising their weapons over their head and bellowing mighty Waaaghs the boyz began to charge the frontline.</P>

<P>Due to the rapid change of direction and spontaneous attack many support vehicles and dreadnoughts were left behind.  Without our serious dakka we were unable to sustain a long offensive and the boyz were cut down and serious casualities mounted.  Warboss Zigzagga barked orders to recall the Waaagh! and regroup. It gave us hope when we saw our warboss was one of the last orks to leave the battlefield with the forces of the ummies surging forward. The hive will have to wait. Several of our speed freeks are beginning to arrive after refueling from the refinery. There is always tomorrow for us and it is just a matter of time before we destroy this whole planet.  WAAAAAAAAGH!!!!!!!!!!</P>
