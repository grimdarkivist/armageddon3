<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/sandersdavis.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT>We hadn't seen the Orks for a couple of days and we were happy for the rest and the chance to catch a little shut eye.  Our scouts were out there and the reports were that the Orks were not gone but mustering their strength and building new weapons of destruction.  They were also probing our defensive line at points to determine our strength.  We had held their blunt frontal attacks off but those Orks might get smart and try to attack from a different direction.</P>

<P>The Orks sent a few of their Deth Koptas flying over our positions to take a look at what we were doing and our Hydra flak tanks sent a few of them crashing to the ground.  The surviving Koptas flew around like crazy to avoid being hit and eventually withdrew from our skies. </P> 

<P>During the day our scouts reported that the Orks were moving around to our right and were preparing to attack.  They were going to come at us from a different direction with the hopes that they would be able to crack our defenses. We could hear their bikes and buggies revving their engines and plumes of dust and smoke could be seen in the distance.  Our commanders ordered us to new positions to defend against this threat.</P>

<P>Later that day, the Orks came at us in a massive wave of noise, smoke, dust, and mad howling. The Warbikes zipped up on the right flank and drove down a guard unit in a matter of seconds. They had no chance with the speed and ferocity of the warbike attack but the heavy bolter teams behind them riddled the bikes with heavy bolter shots until they no longer even twitched.</P>

<P>Commissar Davis loaded the Ogryns into a Chimera and ordered the driver to plow it into the midst of a giant unit of Orks.  The Commissar and Ogryns jumped out and fired away into the Orks then piled into them in an assault.  The Ogryns enjoyed the brute power that they held over the Orks and knocked them senseless, beating them back by the dozens.  The Ogryns were doing quite well until the combat was joined by two Ork Killa Kans. The Ogryns didn't stand a chance and were quickly cut down by the crude Ork weapons.  The Commissar fought on and we could see the flicker of his refractor field as it fended off the Ork attacks.  His faith led us to insane acts of bravery and we knew that the Emperor was on our side. </P>

<P>New orders came through for our troops, we were to capture and secure the plasma refinery and the Adminstratum building from Ork hands as well as destroying the two Russ' that the Orks were using against us.  The insanely brave hive gangers advanced into the Orks and captured the Administratum building.  The Orks surrounded it on all sides but the hivers tossed grenades at the Orks, fired flamers into their midst, threw chunks of building at them, blasted pistols, and did everything in their power that they could to hold the Orks off.  The sheer ferocity of the hivers caught the Orks off guard and they wavered in their advance and failed to use their numbers to swarm the Administratum.</P>

<P>The Black Templars moved towards the plasma refinery and fought the Orks that were nearby.  The Templars were supported on the left by Stormtroopers who destroyed a dreadnought with a well placed plasma rifle shot.  The dread started smoking and went up in a ball of flame, then exploded scattering debris and dropping a few Orks nearby.  The stormtroopers secured the interior of the building while the Templars took up positions around the outside to defend against any Ork attacks.</P> 

<P>Elsewhere the Orks were pressuring us from all sides and our flanks were beginning to falter.  Our basilisk went up in a deafening explosion and the ammunition caught fire sending debris and shells in a wide arc. The Orks had surrounded the plasma refinery and the Adminstratum and were barely being held off. Bikers and Koptas blitzed through our battleline and advanced into our rear echelons. Hopefully our reserves are prepared and ready to fight off the Orks. Even our field kitchens might have to drop their cooking spoons and pick up rifles to defend against the ones that got past us.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/insaneguardplayers.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=LEFT>Since our landing on Armageddon several moons ago we have not maintained a constant offensive towards the inner workings of the 'oomie Hive.  Those elite marines have prevented us from sure victory and our warbosses have had to truly show how resilient their tactics really are.  The initial attack on the refinery was bloody and hard fought but once we took the complex we never held it with any confidence.  Since Warboss Zigzagga fought for dominance over the Waaagh he has slowly lost control over how we attack and why.  Today, we were sent forth just for personal glory and booty.  Some of the bigger nobz sent out patrols of Deth Koptas and Speed Freek bikers to find a weakness in the enemy lines.  Most of them ended up attacking the 'oomies and didn't return with any information.  The ones that did survive gathered enough intelligence for us to concentrate on two buildings located in the oomies flank.  The boyz began to hoot and yell and started running towards the front lines in the hopes to get the first kill.  Small pockets of fire began to break out and the boyz were only invigorated by the close explosions and ricocheting bullets. </P> 

<P>The warbikes and trukks raced forward and boyz jumped out of their vehicles to quickly hack down unsuspecting 'oomies. The guard tanks roared behind the lines and were opening huge gaps in our lines but they were quickly filled with boyz rushing forward. It was surprising to see some 'oomie vehicles surge forward and drop a loading ramp with weird mutated 'oomies who were as large as our nobz running out followed by a black clad ommie. They proceeded to eliminate all manner of orks that attacked them but the killa kans took notice to this fiasco and blazed a trail to engage in combat. The kans made short work of the large 'oomies (Ogryn I heard someone call them), but the black clad commissar deflected blow after blow and even in some instances his protective shield made the huge kans claws glance away from him.  Suddenly just when the commissars light was ready to flicker out thanks to the kans, those super marines entered combat and saved him from his fate.  As the kans pursued the escaping 'oomies, they were quickly destroyed by covering fire from guard tanks. </P> 

<P>Elsewhere on the battlefield the boyz were breaking thru the enemy lines and destroying everything in sight.  As a last ditch effort several 'oomie tanks tried to run over boyz running towards them but the crazier boyz stood in the way until the last minute slapping crude bommz on the side of the tank.  The bommz exploded and blew large pieces of track off the vehicles grinding them to a halt.  The boyz climbed all over the tank and began wildly shooting in the crew hatches killing all survivors of the initial blast.  The only thing that could be heard was the rapid firing of the ork sluggas and the screams of WAAAGH! as the boyz ran down any 'oomie survivors.  The two buildings that we were hoping to take became visible over the horizon and once we moved within yards of the builidings the 'oomies sprang their trap and laid down such a vicious barrage that the boyz were piled ten high.  We knew we couldn't take the buildings and we had to find another way thru the ruins and into the buildings that lay in the middle of the battlefield.  Warboss Zigzagga sent some grots back to the large ork staging area in the hopes that more boyz would become available.  We will wait until nightfall in the hopes of masking our attack. </P>
