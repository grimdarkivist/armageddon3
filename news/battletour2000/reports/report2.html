<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/nick_kyle_arthur_viewscreen.jpg" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="three cheers!" ALIGN=RIGHT>Colonel Rudolph von Bloch returned to our battlelines wearing the remains of his uniform, blood pouring from an open wound in his head along with numerous other minor cuts and bruises.  Our Colonel had returned and all was not lost. We had beaten back the Orks yesterday, and only just barely, and the surviving Orks set about entrenching the ground they had earned. We knew they would launch fresh assault as soon as they regrouped and brought in reinforcements. There was no doubt that the refinery and vast oil supplies were their goal. Our orders were simple, attack and claim the Ork trenches for ourselves, forcing the Orks back into the open ground. We scrambled over the top of the trench and advanced towards the Orks lines. Once the Orks saw that we were advancing upon their positions, they quickly clambered out of their trench and ran towards us howling in their blasphemous language. It was then that I knew we would we have a desperate fight on our hands.</P>

<P>On our right flank, the armoured warriors of the Space Wolves quickly opened fire on the Orks, felling them by the dozens but still they advanced upon us. One Space Wolf assault squad jumped forward and were quickly attacked in melee by reckless Orks wearing rockets on their backs. The assault squad was quickly cut down save for one lone survivor who was then charged by dozens of rocket Orks. He fought on with a fury of a madman and refused to bow to the will of the rocket Orks. The lone marine was quickly joined by other Space Wolves who entered the fray to destroy Orks by the dozens. In front of us, Orks wearing massive suits of steel plates advanced with total disregard to all the fire we could send into their unit.  They would not fall no matter how much fire we poured into them.  It was at this moment that the gravity of the situation became apparent to us.  The Orks were all around us now and all we could do was to hold fast and pray the Emperor would see us safely through this danger.  The Orks in steel plates made it to our battleline tore apart our Hellhound with their crude cutting instruments.  A shot ricocheting off the now open fuel lines of the Hellhound started a massive explosion sending a few of the Orks in plates yards away.  Lucky for us, some of them did not get up again. There were so many Orks that our advance quickly stalled and became a struggle for survival.  I know not of any squad that made it to the Ork trenches, instead we were forced back and rather brutally.  We could not hold and had to fall back inside the refinery complex and stem the Ork tide.</P>

<P>That evening new orders came to us from regimental command - take and hold the oil storage tanks and prevent the Orks from gaining possession of these vital tanks. Ork scouts were seen in the failing light sneaking towards our lines in an attempt to infiltrate our possession.  The Orks came at us in an eerily quietness that we had not known before but we surged forward to meet their advance.  Those storage tanks were ours and by the Emperor we would not yield them.  Our Armoured Fist squad drove up upon the objective and we would remain there throughout the night, repulsing Ork attacks.  There was vicious fighting throughout the night as we struggled to maintain some control of the objective.  At last the Orks had with drawn a short ways but we knew they were out there and would come again.  Colonel von Broch called in for more reinforcements. Once they arrived, we advanced again into the foe to claim the oil storage tanks and the ground around them as ours.  As we did so, we noticed that the Ork numbers had also increased and were hacking away at our troops holding onto the objectives. We fought on but we could only slow the advance of the Orks.  They fought on and surged over the oil tanks to claim them.  Now we can only fall back and prepare better held positions deeper in the refinery. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/teddy_viewscreen.jpg" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Teddy Rogan" ALIGN=LEFT>Standing over the body of Grim Zog Skulkrusha, Speed Freek Warboss Griz Mag Zigzagga took a moment of silence and then looked up at the boyz that surrounded him.  "Wez got a job ta do.  Git in da trukks!  No moor playin' wiv da ommies, just kill dem.  We need da fuul."  The boyz let out a blood curtling WAAAGH!!! and headed toward the front line once more.  Throughout the day the demoralized orks from the first wave of the attack had begun to dig in and build defensive structures.  Unfortunately,  Griz Mag Zigzagga wanted all available orks to charge the front lines again and again in a relentless offensive.  The orders were sent all along the battleline, wait until the cover of darkness before the attack commences.</P>
 
<P>Nightfall came quickly and once the Kommandos snuck into a forward position the remainder of the Waaagh charged forward into combat.  As the boyz climbed out of trenches they were met almost immediately by charging ummies.  The boyz fought hard and several now have to make their peace with Gork and Mork but the ommies were pushed back with a relentless fury of ork close combat.  It looked like the day and the refinery was within our grasp until those infernal grey armoured ommies showed up with more reserves.  They blasted their way through the night as if it were daytime.  The space wolves moved directly towards all the vitally important refinery processing stations and began to defend them with their lives.  And that was exactly what happened, we took their lives and captured several of the stations.  The speed freeks quickly began to siphon fuel for their vehicles and the remainder of the Waaagh attempted to take more stations and fuel pumps. Gork and Mork must have been watching because at our greatest time of need they sent us more boyz and trukks.  But because of the cover of darkness and the unfamiliar territory around the refinery were unable to take it completely.  Small firefights broke out through out the night and the boyz are excited for a new show of force early in the morning.
