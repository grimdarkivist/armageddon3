<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/mikereed.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT> Our major offensive pushed the Orks back into the ash wastes from whence they came.  It was still bitter fighting and we hadn't slept in days.  Our command wanted to keep the Orks off balance and on the defensive.  </P>

<P>We'd pushed them back into an old abandoned imperial outpost whose jagged ruins stood in stark contrast to the smooth grey ash dunes that buried it.  We dug in around the ruins and abandoned scrap piles and prepared to take a short rest before pushing into the Orks again.   Many of us fell asleep instantly and were awoken by a choking, howling wind.  An ash storm had blown in during the night and visibility was reduced to yards.  </P>

<P> Dark, blurred shapes loomed out of the storm and we couldn't tell whether they were friend or foe until the last minute.  It was the Orks and we were under attack!  We started shooting and radioed down the line to inform the other companies that the Orks were attacking.  They creeped up on us and we couldn't hear their engines over the howling wind.  We fought them with guns blazing and when they got too close, they got a taste of our lasgun rifle butts.  They jumped into our trenches and it was a vicious melee.  No quarter was given and none was asked.  We fought to the death and there seemed to be more Orks than Guardsmen.   </P>

<P>We couldn't see what was happening in other parts of our line, but our radio was crackling with reports of Ork assaults.  The Space Wolves on the right side were under serious pressure and were falling back.  Their defensive strength was broken and they were trying to hold on with everything they had, but to no avail.   The Orks were too numerous and swarmed over the Space Wolves.  An single Ork biker destroyed a Rhino and five marine passengers. Things were looking grim...</P>

<P>Under the cover of the raging storm, the Orks gained valuable ground and drove us out of the outpost.  As both sides moved to reinforce their existing territory, the ash storm blew over and we were able to see the Orks more clearly.  We called in some major firepower from our tanks to rout a few Ork units but we didn't have the men necessary to pursue after them and take back a large part of the outpost.  As the battle slowed to a few random shots here and there, we set about preparing defensive positions and mustering our forces for another attack on the Orks.</P>
