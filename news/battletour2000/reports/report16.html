<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/furiousbattle.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Hoorah for the Emperor!" ALIGN=LEFT>After two days of relentless Ork assaults, the green hordes were finally poised to assault the Imperial temple to the south of Hive Helsreach. They had pushed their way in from the sea and their crude landing craft, driven over countless Imperial bodies, and now stood at the gates of a Ministorum temple deep in the heart of sector OB-2N sub.USA!</P>

<P>The forces of the 3rd Catachan Headhunters stood bravely to defend against their heretical alien hides. However, after a bloody combat, the likes of which is only known of in legend, the Greenskins strode over their opponents to occupy the hallowed grounds of the Ministorum structure with impunity!</P>

<P>As the Orks dug in, wave after wave of Armageddon Steel Legion vehicles poured into the valley. Now that we were no longer outgunned or outmanned, our valorous Imperial Guard troops pushed forward on the Ork positions, but by nightfall had not been able to reclaim the temple. The day ended with the sounds of Orks defiling the temple's hallowed halls with their foul alien grafitti and unspeakable battle rituals.</P>

<P>True to the nature of his homeworld, <B>Captain Jon Shelbow</B> of the 3rd Catachan was awarded the Emperor's Cross (posthumously) for his heroic defense of the Chapel. He took on no less than 15 Ork Boyz with nothing but a bolt pistol which quickly ran out of ammo and then nothing but his razor keen Catachan 'Night Raider' pattern combat knife!</P>

<P>Even the herculean efforts of the Catachan forces could not drive the foul aliens from the temple and the Imperial attack had to be discontinued in order to regroup and reorganize. Colonel Simthin has been executed for dereliction of duty and Captain Randard promoted to brevet Colonel in his place. Colonel Randard promises to take the temple on the following day at all costs!!!</P>

<P>Those Jungle boyz sure can fight. Tougher than a Cave Squig dey iz! But we 'ad em in the end. Nuthin can stand up to da boyz once they start choppin' their way across a battlefield. We knew that we had to get into that temple fingy so we could stash our shootas and ammo so we we're gonna be held up by a bunch of weedy 'oomies with choppas and stubbas.</P>

<P>After a good scrap, we drove 'em out of the area and started to make the temple look propa for the battle. It was about this time that the Steel boyz tanks started to roll in. By Mork, there were alot of them, but a few Tankbusta charges and some shots from the rokkit boyz managed to turn most of them into scrap. At the end of the day we manged to krump 'em good and 'ad a good 'ed bashin' on those jungle boyz as well. Bring it on 'oomies! Ghazghkull's back and this time it's WAAAGH!</P>
