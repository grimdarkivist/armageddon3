<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/walterrafalko.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=RIGHT>We took our positions among the ruins of our once great hive. The majority of the outlying spires had been decimated. The "Cathedral of Everlasting Hope" was one of the last bastions of the Emperor's light and we could not let it fall to the tide of Orks that have overwhelmed Armageddon.  The Asgardian Rangers have been reassigned from the Deadlands and have come to support my Steel Legion squads. My men have not slept in days but we cannot let the weakness show. The forces that stand around us have come to save our planet so we must set the example and be ever vigilant.</P> 

The fighting began with promise with our tanks delivering massive destruction to the initial Ork attack. The tide began to turn when the Orks did not stop their advance. The red wheels of their vehicles turning up the dust of what was once our home. The Orks halted the attack to an extent and appeared to be searching through a downed titan from the Legio Ignatum. Our main bunker that held the mortar positions was overwhelmed with the smaller but no less vicious Greenskins.</P>
 
The situation appeared hopeless as my men dropped like razorwings in the Fire Wastes. The comm-links blared the arrival of the Salamanders. Their green armor deflected shot after shot from the massive horde but their presence was not enough. The Orks were running over our positions except for the Cathedral. This would be our last stand. I ordered the remnants of my platoon to join the Rangers in the Cathedral and hold out as long as possible. I must find a way to get reinforcements, any reinforcements. Only time will tell...</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/orkyplayersnocontrol.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=LEFT>Da Big Boss wuz getting mad cause we were getting' low on bullets. They're no good after you shoot the fleshy oomies with them, and the hard oomies are just as bad 'cause they wear all that armor.  One of their skinny Gargants tripped over one of my wartraks last week and has not moved since. Since there are some Big Gunz on it there should be some big bullets in dere too. </P>

<P>Da 'riders came back from lookin' at the spot were the ammo wuz and said that they were only a few squads of those oomies with no faces and shiny eyes. Dey had a few of there trukks that had roofs dere too. When we finally showed up, dere wuz da no face oomies, but dere wuz more oomies wearing snow clothes in da big fancy building that did not fall down yet. Da boyz were itchin for a fight so I cut dem loose. Da boyz went to get the ammo but were distracted by so many targets to shoot at. Slowly they finally made it to the Wreck of da Skinny Gargant. Da Grots saw what was going on and did not want to be showed up so dey stormed across da field and took out a bunker that was throwin' up shells at us the whole battle. As soon as dat happened da Green Armored guys show up and start shooting all of my boyz. I did not want to fight dem cause dey look like uz, but dey shot us first and my boyz don't like that, so we stomped 'em.</P>

<P>All da little oomies ran into the big building and some of da boyz tried to go afta dem but da Boss came on da speakers and told us dat he needed da ammo for da big gunz poundin' da trenches. We let dem keep their building but there were not that many left anyway.</P>
