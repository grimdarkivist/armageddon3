<P>As the Orks were drawing near to us, we opened fire tearing great holes in their line.  Our mortars pumped shell after shell with a methodical <I>dooomph</I> sound into the advance of gretchin and Orks.  The gretchin hit the ground and scrambled for cover, while our heavy bolters tore into the still advancing Orks.</P>

<P>Our Leman Russ engaged in a long range duel with a looted tank, blowing off its right track in a huge blast and giving covering fire for our advancing Hellhound and Chimera.  The Hellhound was slowly picking its way through the ruins, flame spewing forth from its turret at Orks hiding amongst the ruins.  The Chimera slowly followed, its occupants firing flamers and lasguns at any survivors from the blistering inferno of the Hellhound.</P>  

<P>Our right flank was being hit hard by trukkboyz, sluggaboyz, and warbikes.  They arrived quicker than we expected and jumped all over our lads in the trenches.  They fought back with tenacity but there were too many Orks for them to deal with, though they had cut down the Ork numbers considerably.  The orks continued to advance into the right flank and were moments away from crushing it completely.  A well timed arrival of Rough Riders broke the largest mob of Orks and stemmed the tide of defeat.</P>

<P>The Templars advanced into the foe, shooting and hacking away at Orks as they went.  Their  Crusader formed a barrier in the center of the line and seemed to disgorge Marines by the dozen into the Ork lines.  The tenacity of the marines overcame the brute force of the Orks, and they began to flee, first in small units and then it was the hold flank fleeing.  The Templars turned towards the Imperial right flank to support the Guardsmen coming under severe pressure.  Their arrival was too much for the Orks and we slowly pushed the Orks from the area towards the outer reaches of the hive.</P>

<P>Licking the wounds from our previous days fighting and collecting small pockets of ork boyz, who were the remainders of their once proud tribal warband, we set off once again hoping to tear huge holes in the lines of those blasted 'oomies.  The grotz started to take heavy fire and huge blasts from mortars sent their running for cover.  The slaver looked around almost dazed because his little grotz were gone and before he started collecting them the slaver took several shots from a heavy bolter leaving huge holes throughout his body.  His body stiffened and collapsed almost immediately as he was trampled by the orks running behind him using the grotz for cover.</P>

<P>The roar of the engines and the plumes of smoke filled the air as the trukkboyz set off in a valiant effort to recapture any territory lost throughout our war here on Armageddon.  Lasgun fire and small weapons fire cascaded off the armor of the trukk and the boyz felt quite secure in their open topped vehicle.  Bombs and missiles began raining down and when the smoke cleared the lucky trukboyz managed to charge forward on foot while the unlucky were buried in the rubble with their vehicle.  Several hundred Orks all managed to hit the battle line in succession and we fought with vengeance and furious anger only to be quickly driven back by the exploits of those blasted Black Templars.  The Marines supported by their vehicles marched forward in expressionless unison firing their boltguns without remorse.  The Stormboyz were being chewed up through the meat grinder of the marines but the nobz equipped in mega armour guarding their warboss soon entered the fray.  The invincible strength of their power claws opened the marines armor and tore the 'oomie bodies apart.  The gore and destruction of their comrades did not seem to phase them in the least but rather they just fought harder.  Maybe they knew their fate and decided to die honorable, a respectable quality for a 'oomie.</P>

<P>Our looted vehicles rumbled to a halt to prepare and shoot their mighty battle cannons.  Inside the armored belly Orks argued and pulled levers and pushed buttons until the roar of the cannon expelled its projectile.  The Orks inside began to reload and at that moment the tank lurched forward forcing the Ork gunner to fall on the lever knocking the barrel of the cannon aiming the next shot into the ground before the tank.  As soon as we glanced at the commotion a huge explosion formed in front of the tank and flames engulfed the vehicle.  The Orks around the tank only seemed to be bothered about being knocked down rather than losing the looted armor.  Speed Freek bikers and deth koptas charged forward and the black smoke from their exhausts hid their slimy green skin.  The pilots kept the trigger of the weapons depressed during their entire flight to the extent that the barrels were warping due to extreme heat.  Something like that the big mek can fix later after the battle.  </P>

 <P>Surveying the battlefield, huge pockets of Orks lay dead or dying and the 'oomies maintained their battleline.  The marines kept pushing forward forcing our warband into a narrow strip of land located within the ruins.  There, imperial guardsmen pushed forward and set up ambushes wiping out orks in the hundreds.  We didn't stand a chance today and the hopes of destroying this planet seem lost.  Warboss Zigzagga seems to recognize his failure because he doesn't seem as aggressive as he was when we first landed months ago.  In the background we can see Orks running for cover as hellhound tanks lay down huge amounts of burning fuel engulfing them.  Our efforts this day were now to escape with our lives and regroup for one final attack.  We heard of another warband moving into this area and we hope to communicate with them tonight and coordinate our attack.  We still have our lives so we can claim victory and we will destroy as many 'oomies to aid our fellow Orks and Ghazghkull who battle elsewhere on this planet.</P>
