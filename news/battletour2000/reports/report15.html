<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/imperialjoy.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Hoorah for the Emperor!" ALIGN=LEFT>As the battle across the Plains of Showcayz begann, we knew that this would be our last push to retake the Ministorum temple which had been engulfed by the Greenskin horde. Driving on the dug in Orks were a dozen Armored Fist Squads, and a full division of Leman Russ and Basilisks. By midday these mighty engines of the Emperor's wrath (blessed be his name) had recovered about half the field, but Ork reinforcements still held the temple and we knew that the Greenskins were nothing if not cunning.</P>

<P>It was Colonel Randard of the 32nd Jopall Indentured who conceived of a plan bold enough to commit our forces before the Orks desecrated the Temple beyond repair and dealt a vicious blow to Imperial morale. However, whether his tactics would result in a successful mission was a matter of debate among the command staff. Under cover of darkness, a squad of Imperial Storm Troopers had infiltrated behind the Ork lines and taken up a position near the Imperial temple. When the Greenskin sentries were disposed of and a direct path to the objective was clear, they activated the Teleport Homer which summoned a Space Marine Strike Team from an orbiting Strike Cruiser. Though they died to the last man trying to protect it, their valiant actions allowed four squads of Salamanders, including Chaplain Xavier himself, to teleport in.</P>

<P>Realizing that their prize was about to fall, the Orks sent their mobile units racing to the chapel while their boyz mobs held Imperial assault teams on the front lines back. The Salamanders pushed their way to the Chapel again and again, truly living up to their tenacious and methodical reputation. Each time the Orks pushed them back with a ferocity which matched the Salamanders' determination. Ork Choppa and Space Marine combat blade chopped through the ranks with equal fury as precious Space Marine vitae and corrupted Ork ichor fell in vast amounts in the trenches!</P>

<P>Finally, as night was falling Xavier entered the Chapel and retrieved the Holy Relics within including a precious vial purpoted to contain the tears of the Emperor himself. Though this has done wonders for the morale of our Imperial forces which are now pinned down in the area outside of the temple complex, the Orks still hold this strategic building and have easy access to Hive Helsreach's southern flank.</P>

<P>Due to his obvious incompetence under fire, Colonel Randard has been summarily executed on order of 
General Milnivil, who was then shot by his own Commissar. Case file on these 
incidents will be closed pending review by the Inquisition.</P>

<P>By Gork I really love the smell of dead 'oomies in the mornin'! Those soft Impy boyz thought that we wouldn't be ready for 'em, but we showed 'em good. They thought it was over, but it's just begun!!! Some of their sneaky boyz managed to get behind our pickets and take out a few Grots with their high-powered light shootas. A few krumps on the head from a choppa and they break open just as easy as the rest, even with their hard shell. The only problem wuz, they managed to get their blinky gubbinz going before we could pound them to mush. That wuz when the beakies started to show up...</P>
 
<P>Even though we were krumpin the 'oomies good on the front lines, things started get rough when the beakies turned up through their tellyporta. I guess the sneaky 'oomie boyz managed to set it off before we smashed 'em good. Bad enough that they were beakies, but they were the green kind as well. Now although those boyz are painted propa and all just like us Orks, they really can lay a broozin on a boy if you let 'em get too uppity. Most of the time they can bust you up so bad that not even a Mad Dok can put you back together, so they had to go.</P>

<P>Although the green beakies tried to act like propa Orks and lay a krumpin' on us, they only managed to get their boss into the temple we had captured. I think I saw him runnin' away with some glass vials and stuff. He didn't even bother to grab some of our shootas or ammo we had stashed there. After that the 'oomies just sort of gave up and faded away into the hills. Guess they had enough of a clobberin' for today. Still and all, now that we've kept the temple-fingy and can get into da city, tonight we'll really get to Waaagh!!!</P>
