<P>The Orks were hiding amongst the ruins outside the hive and were awaiting the fall of darkness before they attacked.  We took the time to ensure that all the spotlights on our vehicles were in working order as we would be depending on them in the failing light.  We worked on setting up barricades and kill zones.  We would not let any Orks pass this night, lest we fail the populace of Hive Helsreach.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/grotman.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT>We set up our battle command post in a large Imperial building where we would have good lines of sight and fields of fire.  We could see some Orks off in the distance silhoutted by some of the burning ruins but they were too far away to shoot at.  We could tell they were getting ready to mount another attack and we were calling for more tanks but the request was denied.</P>

<P>We heard the starting of numerous engines and the time for battle was near.  The deafening roar of all those engines made our heads swim but we held fast and prepared our weapons and our faith.  We could hear the bikes zipping around and we could catch glimpses of them.  We opened fire with everything we had, and our artillery smashed into their units in a walking barrage.  But still they came at us.</P>

<P>Our position in the building gave a wide view of the battle, everywhere there was shouts and explosions.   We could see the Ork Koptas zoom up on the left flank but the amount of fire they received more than hurt them.  Koptas by the dozens dropped from the sky and exploded amongst the Ork units below.  </P>

<P>On the right, several tanks moved onto the motorway to block the Ork bikers from getting past.  Their guns fired as fast as they could and caused a heavy toll on the bikers.  Some of the bikers were able to get past and they fired their guns and lobbed bombs at the tanks, but they were quickly picked off by the Ratling Snipers hiding in a few of the buildings beyond the tanks.  No Ork made it past the line of tanks on the right flank.  The sheer volume of firepower was too much for the Orks and they were slowly pushed back.</P>

<P>Ork Stormboyz jumped up to our building and tossed in some grenades to try to get us to run out.  We threw grenades back at them and the Stormboyz burst in and a hard fought combat ensued.  The Stormboyz were starting to get the best of us and more began pouring through the door.  An Ork kill team jumped into the room and began to flame every Ork in the room as well as the ones pouring through the door.  The Orks howled in pain and we countinued to hack at the Orks that we still in melee.  We outnumbered them and the smarter Orks decided to get out of the building while they could and ran. We struck down quite a few of them as they turned and ran but we didn�t get them all.  You can bet they'll think twice before entering one of our buildings again.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/oomiesmasha.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=LEFT>The oomies were putting up a good zoggin fight but we were going to bash them reeeeel good.  We were waiting for darkness when they would be good and scared when we yell Waaagh! and fire off our shootas at their lines.  That confusion coupled with the engines of the Koptas and Speed Freaks will keep them off guard long enough for da boyz to get stuck in and kill oomies. </P>

<P>The night came and our warboss got all the ladz together for a mighty Waaagh!  The Waaagh! was so loud that it shook the buildings.  All the boyz was giving out the loudest Waaagh! they had and the oomies were scared.  They knew we were coming and they couldn't do anything about it.  We had more dakka and more Waaagh!</P>

<P>The Kommandos went off on their own to lay down a smoke screen for the boyz.  The Kommandos weren't gone for a few minutes before the Speed Freaks started up their bikes and roared off.  The Trukkboyz weren't about to be outdone and they jumped in their truks and sped off after the Speed Freaks.  The attack started sooner than what Warboss Zigzagga wanted and someone would get crunched in the 'ead for that one.  The rest of the boyz took off too as they wanted to get in on the oomie stompin action.</P>

<P>We were all running towards the oomies with our shootas blazing away at the oomies trenches.  Their tanks turned on their lights and started firing at our boyz.  It was hard for them to shoot our boyz because of the darkness, but they still tried.</P>

<P>The Trukkboyz were firing their shootas and yelling Waaagh! as they raced towards the oomie line.  Some of the trukks got hit and flipped over.  The boyz picked themselves up off the ground, spat out the dirt from their mouths, yelled Waaagh! some more, and charged the oomies.  They got stuck in and whacked some oomies and then whacked some more.</P>

<P>The loota boyz fired their lascannons at the oomie tanks and one went up in a big explosion.  The fire illuminated all the oomies in the area and the shoota boys ran towards them, firing away with their shootas.  A few of the boyz dropped from the oomie fire but there were too many boyz to be stopped.  They jumped into the oomie trench and gave 'em a good kickin.  Once they'd finished with those oomies they found some more in a different trench and began running towards them.
</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/news/battletour2000/images/licenceplatedude.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT>The Killa Kans and a Big Dread moved towards the oomies and the oomies we firing their big gunz at them.  One of the kans was hit in the leg and slowly collapsed towards the ground, its guns still blazing.  The other kans and dread kept going and their shootas lashed out towards the oomies.</P>

<P>The Sluggaboyz made it to one of the buildings that Warboss Zigzagga said we had to take and quickly ran away like a stinkin' git as the oomie skorchas chased them out.  Some of the boyz on fire didn't get very far as they fell to the ground and continued to burn.  The Slugga boyz ran back to our lines and joined up with the lootaboyz.</P>

<P>The Stormboyz launched themselves towards a big oomie building and landed just outside.  They went rushing in with stickbombz and choppas.  A few loud explosions came from the building and then there was a great gout of fire being shot all over.  The oomies had a burna squad in the building and were skorching the Stormboyz out of the building.  One Stormboy on fire launched himself from a window in a spiral arc and crashed into the ground.  The rest of the Stormboyz had enough of the oomies and retreated out of the building.</P>

<P>The oomies were too strong and they pushed us back out of the city.  We'll regroup and beat them cause Orks is never beaten in battle.  If we win we win, if we die we die so it don't count as beat.  If we runs for it we don't die neither, so we can always come back for anuvver go.  We'll give those oomies anuvver go soon enuff.  We is calling in da Deff Skwad.</P>
