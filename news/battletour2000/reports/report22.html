<P>As the ash storm diminished, the Orks began to push into the destroyed remnants of the abandoned Imperial outpost.  Long since abandoned, we scoured the ruins for defensive positions and equipment that might prove useful.  One area in particular warranted special attention.  It was a minefield cluttered with wrecked vehicles and a few skeletons.  Not knowing this lay ahead of them, the Orks were sure to take some extra casualties.  </P>

<P>The Orks came at us with a mighty Waaagh but weeks of fighting against them prepared us for them.  As their vehicles surged forward in huge clouds of smoke, dust, and ash, they advanced howling and brandishing their weapons.  Not to be outdone, the mounted Pyran Dragoons on the right flank charged into a mob of fifty orks.  Their explosive tipped lances exploded with devastating results, but the Orks eagerly fought back and did not run.  The outnumbered Dragoons were pulled from their horses and quickly swept underfoot as the mob of Orks charged into the Imperial battleline.   </P>

<P>Seeing the Dragoons defeated filled us with a righteous fury and all along our battleline, guardsmen and marines surged from their trenches to engage the Orks.   Our tanks fired shells over our heads to rip deadly holes in the Ork lines but still they came.  One Ork truck was hit by a shell and exploded, flipping over and spreading burning fuel in a wide arc, catching numerous Orks on fire.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/erikarice.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT>The Black Templars charged into the remnants of the Ork truckers and eliminated them in a decidedly quick hand to hand combat.  As the Templars moved to consolidate their position and advance, a looted Leman Russ lurched around the corner of a building and fired.  The resulting explosion sent armoured bodies flying through the air, and only a fraction of the squad remained standing.  Ork buggies drove up on the Marines and fired their flamers, engulfing the survivors in a holocaust of burning fuel.  </P>

<P>The Ork Stormboyz flew through the sky and dropped into an Imperial occupied building surprising the Guardsmen.  In the swirling melee, the guardsmen fought with insane fury, madly hacking away at the Stormboyz.  It looked to be an even fight but the rest of the Stormboyz joined the fray and their numbers gave the Orks the advantage.The guardsmen were vanquished and the Stormboyz leapt into the air in search of more targets.  </P>

<P>We fought, like we had never fought before.  All around were shouts of "For the Emperor, Death or Glory, and Our Faith is Our Shield!"  The combat was savage, each man and Ork struggled for survival and knew that insane fury was the best attack. Slowly we beat back the Orks but the victory was a hollow one.  The cost had been staggering.  Everywhere we looked, there were piles of shattered bodies, hideously disfigured men amongst others with the look of peaceful slumber.  </P>

<P>We had so many guardsmen in our battleline that we were too much for the Orks and we began to push them back from the hive.  We kept on them as we could and brought in some Armoured Fist squads and tanks to roust out the stubborn pockets of resistance.  By morning, there were no Ork survivors in the ruins and there would be no sleep as our commanders wanted us to pursue the Orks into the ash wastes. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/mikecopenhaver.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=LEFT>We could see the oomies hiding in their trenches, afraid to fight like real Orks.  We would have to go over there and give them a dead 'ard good kickin'.  Da Oomie Crusha led his boys into the middle of the oomie horse riders and pulled all the riders to the ground for a good stompin'.  Once his ladz were done fighting the riders, they ran over to the oomies hiding in the trenches and gave them a good crumpin.     </P>

<P>The stikkbommerz advanced up behind some pipes and lobbed stikkbomz at the oomies in the trenches.  The oomie marineboyz charged into da stikkbommerz and beat them senseless.  The marineboyz then charged into the skorched trukkboyz whose truk blew up spreading burning fuel all around.  The trukkboyz jumped clear and bashed on the marineboyz armour but the marineboyz were tough gitz and they ended up crushing the trukkboyz.  </P>

<P>Our looted tank blasted those marineboyz to bitz in a big zoggin explosion and the ones that were still standing got blasted by our boyz and skorcha-buggies.  The tank continued to blast away at the oomies.  </P>

<P>The big nobz in mega-armour advanced into marineboyz on the right side and gave them a good stomping.  They kept going into more oomies and gave them the boot too. WAAAGH!</P>

<P>Our boyz were everywhere and we were beating up the oomies pretty good.  The Speed Freeks' engines belched out smoke and they zipped towards the oomies with their big shootas blasting away.  The Deth Koptas followed in their wake and drove into a oomie squad.  The oomies put up a good fight and the Koptas couldn't beat them.  Eventually the Koptas were knocked from the sky by grenades and rocks, then oomies came at us.  We had lotz of boyz but most of them were stoopid enough to get all shot up. It wuz time ta go.</P>
