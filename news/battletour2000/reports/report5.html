<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/randomdudesviewscreen.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="Results" ALIGN=RIGHT>Radar scans from the night before detected a small group of Ork Fighta Bommaz flying low over Imperial Core IT82. This single core station supplies power for several defensive measures along Hel's Highway. These measures include Anti Aircraft batteries and several automated defensive units like those at outposts J-72 and K-76. Naturally these Ork planes arose a bit of suspicion and measures were taken against them. A few well placed shots from a Steel Legion Platoon brought these Re-con planes down.</P>

<P>Two of the planes were enveloped by their own flames and destroyed in huge exlosions before making contact with the ground. The one remaining plane crashed a few miles East of Imperial Core IT82. Units were mobilized to find the recon unit and make sure any data it may have picked up was destroyed. Imperial Core IT82 is an integral part of the Hel's Highway defense system, and it's low key nature is it's best defense. Should the Orks learn it's true purpose, their terrible crusade will be made ten times easier.</P>

<P>Upon arrival, at the spproximate crash site, Orks were detected in the area. Apparently the Fighta Bommaz had been sent with purpose. Curse the foul vermin! Despite their feral nature, we must not underestimate their intelligence.</P>

<P>Imperial Guard Steel Legion units were ordered to silence the Speed Freeks to the east of the downed Fighta Bomma, while the Salamanders were given the task of cleansing the western front of a large mass of Orks on foot.</P>

<P>As the Steel Legion neared their targets, another wave of Deth Kopters sped into the fray completely overrunning the eastern flank. The victorious Speed Freeks sped towards the objective unhindered. All seemed lost, but the Salamanders bravely held their own against the alien horde, buying time as reinforcements began to filter in from Imperial Core IT82. Although the Orks had indeed retrieved the recon data from the wreckage, by the Emperor they would not escape with it.</P>

<P>Heavy support in the form of Leman Russ amd Basilisk tanks rumbled into the battlezone, pounding the Orks as they attemped to leave with the data. Another mechanized legion of Chimera carriers cut off their retreat and held them up. The cost of human life was great, but their blood did not go to waste. The Salamanders pursuit finished off the Ork scum and the data was once again in Imperial hands. It appears the Imperium had barely escaped a serious loss to the defensive of Hel's Highway, we must be more careful.</P>

<P>Ugnasher Zingbatz had been sent up in his Fighta Bomma to collect data on some stupid human buildings. So he dropped to a low altitude and disarmed his weapons to avoid detection, while his two wing mates did the same. <I>"Dis iz a buncha zoggin waste"</I> Ugnasher thought to himself as his scanners did their work.</P>

<P>After the initial flyby he began to set a course for the airstrips back at base camp. But before he could set the final co-ordinates, Ringbucketz's plane went up in flames, Slugnatter's plane quickly followed suit. Ugnasher kicked in the afterburners and sped off as a hit pentrated his main engines. Doing his best he fought the uncooperative controls and prepared for a rough landing. He never even felt the impact as the cockpit drove itself into the ground and the craft landed belly up.</P>

<P>Warboss Ulrack Mugginsiffer was sent with a strong force of Speed Freeks and boyz to retrieve the little black box from a downed fighta bomma. Why he had to do this did not matter, he didn't care. Oomies were bound to be nearby the plane because it got stuff about them they didn't want Ghazghkull to know. So that meant there was going to be a good scrap!</P>

<P>At the crash site Ulrack led the way on the east with a massive squadron of Deth Koptas in support, while the boys slogged it towards the target from the west. At first there was nothing, then a bunch of Chimeras came into view. The attack on these foolish oomies was brief and unsatisfying. So Ulrack began to make for the downed Fighta Bomma in hopes of a better fight. The boys on the west met stiff opposition in the form of Slamanders Space Marines. But it was all for nothing because Ulrack's Mekboyz had already dug out the the black box and it was time to report back with it.</P>

<P>This turned out to be easier said than done. A strong unit of Chimera mounted Imperial Guard oomies halted the retreat from the battlezone. To make matters worse, heavy support fire rained down on all sides from oomie big gunz we had failed to neutralize. The combined effort of these gunz and the Chimera oomies slowed the Ork horde down, and the Salamanders were making a mockery of the boyz and Ulrack's army. The Warboss broke through the Space Marine battlelines, but all of his mek's were lost, and this meant the black box was lost too. Ulrack did not look forward to reporting this embarassin' defeat at the hands of the oomie chumps. However he did have a chance to check out some of that data from the Fighta Bomma. It was only partial, but he repeated it to himself over and over in hopes that he would not forget it before he could report what he knew.</P>
