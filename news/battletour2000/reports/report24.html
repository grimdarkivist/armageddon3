<P><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/news/battletour2000/images/orkgeneralsprep.gif" HEIGHT=381 WIDTH=256 ALT="viewscreen" ALIGN=RIGHT>Reports had come to my attention that some of the traitor's militia belonging to the loathsome Von Strab was moving into position against me along with a number of ork mobs. I decided, and my commissar approved, the mission should be to destroy these foul heretics. The Guard forces under my command moved forward and soon came within range of our enemies.</P>

<P>Lasgun fire and huge artillery shells began to fly with the traitor militia catching the worse. Then the Orks came out of their trenches and began to rush us. I despaired, keeping my doubts off my face so that I would not be executed by Commissar Dexceri. The odds of the Imperial line holding back that huge green wave were minimal. Then the unexpected happened, Black Templar marines erupted from their hiding places and surged into the Ork lines creating a huge disruption that slowed the Ork advance.  Just as it seemed that dawn must end the sky mysteriously darkened again (no lie, the power actually went out plunging the game into darkness). Despite the faint light the battle continued (again no lie, we played by the light coming in through the windows). </P>

<P>Several times during the battle a horrifying sight gripped by eyes. From craters and from under the earth Ork Dreadnoughts emerged to enter the fray. Whether they had been cunningly buried as a trap or were left over from the last invasion force I shall never know but the carnage they caused was tremendous. After several furious hours of fighting Von Strab's traitors were destroyed and the Ork warboss had retreated into a huge bunker. Since the momentum was with us we continued the battle in order to push forward and eliminate the warboss. It was my hope that with this beast dead the Orks in this sector would lose direction and become easy prey.</P>

<P>Reinforcements of space marines began to arrive to help me achieve this and some of the most intense fighting that has occurred on Armageddon began. Our heavy weapon sections began to destroy huge numbers of killer kans that had been devastating the marine squads. After several hours the turning point in the battle was reached when one of the mighty marine Dreadnoughts waded into the fray. Until then the warboss and his retinue were embroiled in hand to hand with marines and the combat was surging back and forth. When the mighty Dreadnought began crushing Orks left and right and reached the warboss, the beast was not lacking in courage.  He swung a mighty blow with his huge weapon but it was powered by mere flesh and bone and thus no match for the adamantine armor of the Dreadnought. It's huge powerfist engulfed the Ork leader's torso and closed, crushing the life out of the Ork. </P>

<P>With the death of their leader the Orks lost heart and began to withdraw. We eased our assault as the men were tired and our stores of ammunition were dangerously depleted. This allowed the Orks to break contact but the space marines continued to harry them in order to keep the Orks from regrouping, or so I hoped. </P>
