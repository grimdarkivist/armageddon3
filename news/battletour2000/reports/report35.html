<P>With our numbers of guardsmen dwindling rapidly in the face of continuous Ork attacks, we called for additional reinforcements.  We were blessed by the Emperor when both the Black Templars and the Space Wolves brought units and armour to the front to support us.  </P>

<P>The Orks raised a mighty Waaagh! and came at us in typical Ork fashion: loud, boisterous, and full of low down, sneaky cunning.  As they advanced towards us, our lascannons bit deep into their kans and tanks, destroying many.  Those that weren't destroyed were engaged by the Space Wolf dreadnoughts which soon became climactic battles for supremacy.  Great sagas could be told of the ensuing melee as both types of amored beast fought to gain advantage over the other.  Their combat weapons raked across each others armour, showering the ground with sparks and flakes of metal.  Each struggled for supremacy as they slowly whirled about, parrying each others blows.  Then disaster struck, the ork dreadnought severed the arm of the Wolf dreadnought, causing it to fall to the ground, leaving the dreadnought with only its massive bulk to attack with.  Its only chance was to knock the ork dread to the ground but another sweep of the orks power saw cut the power cables to the legs of the Wolf dread, rendering it incapable of fighting back.</P>  

<P>The orks advancing on the left flank were cut down by the Space Wolves, their firing creating great gaps within the Ork line.  The grey hunters zipped up in their rhino and disembarked into a unit of Orks beating them senseless.  They swifly followed the retreating Orks, slamming into a unit of gretchin and cutting them down.  The Space Wolves thundered down on the Orks and utterly destroyed them.  Very few Orks remained and we gained ground on the Orks.  Victory was ours and we will sweep the Orks from the outer reaches of the hive.</P>

<P>The smell of 'oomies roasting over the open fires made us hungrier than we already were.  The greatest thing about victory is the fact that our food has already been hunted and killed but sometimes you end up swallowing more slugga rounds than you do flesh.  The Warbosses are pleased but without the physical presence of the enemy anywhere to be found, we began to miss the confusion of combat.  Warlord Zigzagga does not want any contact with the 'oomies until daylight. He expects the dreaded Space Wolves to be in the area and he knows he can't win battling in the confines of the ruins with the keen senses of those marines.  Wild games like grot tossing were taking place all over the camp and the Speed Freeks were tearing up the countryside whirling around on their bikes and Deth Koptas.  Suddenly, a huge explosion ripped through the air and our first impression was we were under attack.  Upon closer inspection two Deth Kopta pilots had collided in midair creating two huge fireballs as the fuel ignited exploded the tanks and ammunition.  The celebration continued throughout the night and finally when morning arrived the great warband awoke tired and cranky.  </P>

 <P>Assembling our forces together and mounting an offensive was very difficult for the bosses to oversee and the scream of incoming shells followed by rapid successive explosions startled even the 'ardest of orks.  In one unified motion the tidal wave of Orks looked up to witness their most demoralizing moment. There, defending the outskirts of the Hive were two of the humans finest warriors, the Black Templars and Space Wolves.  The boyz knew their end was near but the smart nobz and bosses looked at this as a omen.  "Wez made dem 'oomies bring da best.  We iz da best der iz'", exclaimed one of the nobz.  Several bosses followed suit and began to tell us that we forced the 'oomies to bring their best fighters the Imperium had to offer.  We must have been doing something right and we knew if we could be victorious today nothing could stop us from taking the planet.  </P>

<P>The marines opened up with a vicious volley of devastating boltgun fire and the whoosh from the vindicator and whirlwind delivering their payloads crushed pockets of advancing orks.  We were steadily making our way through the rubble and closing into hand-to-hand combat quickly.  Several Speed Freek bikers and Trukk boyz launched themselves into combat ravaging the marines hiding in the trenches.  The boyz wiping the blood off of their choppas advanced forward only to be cut down in a horrendous crossfire.  Our heavier machinery didn't fair much better as marines armed with rocket launchers and meltaguns dispatched any dreadnoughts or killa kans foolish enough to reach their weapons range.  Three bright lights emerged from a marine predator and formed into large beams of deadly light.  The three killa kans receiving the blows became immobilized charred wrecks.  The day was not ours to be had and Gork and Mork were not overseeing our battle on this day.</P>
