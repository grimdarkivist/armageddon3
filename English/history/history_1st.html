One theory purported by some Imperial scholars is that, mercifully infrequently, the powers of Chaos set aside their rivalries and join together in a common cause, usually war with the followers of the Emperor of mankind - their most hated enemy. <p>Such unholy amalgamations of hatred, greed, bloodlust and corruption are a melting pot of doom and as such these coalitions are uncaring as to where they vent their fury, leaving the location to the fickle currents of the Eye of Terror. The Chaos horde, which fell upon Armageddon with such ferocity, was such a case in point. <p>A series of unnatural and unexplained events led to open, armed rebellion in a handful of hive cities, rebellions which were swiftly put down in the region of Armageddon Secundus, as the hives were geographically close. In the Armageddon Primus region however the hives were more widely spread thus hampering the loyalist forces attempts to restore imperial rule of law.<p>Their attention consumed by the insurrection wracking their cities, the Imperial forces were caught completely by surprise when the Chaos ship, Devourer of Stars, appeared in the heart of the Armageddon sub-sector. Aboard the vast space craft a huge Chaos army led by Angron, Daemon Primarch of the World Eaters Space Marines who accompanied him on this monstrous vessel along with hordes of dark, twisted daemonic creatures which swept across the lands of Armageddon.<p>The subtle, yet deadly tendrils of Chaos were quickly felt as the Imperial forces once again faced rebellion as fully half of their number defected to Chaos, the few remaining loyalist defenders being efficiently routed from Armageddon Prime. The all but defeated remnants of the Imperial defence forces fell back through the thick equatorial jungle, eventually joining forces with scattered pockets of survivors from Armageddon Secundus. This collection of troops regrouped and prepared to make a last stand along the banks of the rivers Styx and Chaeron.<P><IMG SRC="Images/fatalflawtext.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=431  alt="Fatal Flaw"><br>Despite the heavy defeats they had so recently suffered, the Imperial defence was well organised. This defence was further bolstered when Space Marines of the Space Wolves chapter moved to the aid of the beleaguered defenders in direct response to widespread distress signals. The presence of the Space Wolves, assigned to this sector only recently, was unknown to the forces of Chaos. The defenders gained valuable time when Angron, replete with success, spent weeks erecting loathsome monuments in homage to the Powers of Chaos rather <IMG SRC="images/history_possess.gif" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=155 align="left"> than choosing to run down the shattered, fragments of the Imperial armies.<p>Angron's failure to press home his advantage cost him dear. Emerging from the equatorial jungle that bisected the main landmass on Armageddon and separated Primus and Secundus his army found a well-prepared, dug in force of defences reinforced by the Wolves of Fenris.<p>Titanic battles raged all along the front line as tides of Chaos smashed into the resolute banks of Imperial troops. On the banks of the River Chaeron the Imperial line held firm and the broken forces of Chaos were thrown back in disarray. Further to the west the battle was not going so well for the loyalists as Angron personally led the attack, carving his way through the Imperial lines leading his forces towards the hive cities of Infernus and Helsreach. At this crucial point in the battle Logan Grimnar, great Wolf and leader of the Space Wolves, played his trump card - a full company of Grey Knights, warriors trained to deal with otherworldly threats such as these. With remarkable foresight Logan Grimnar had requested the presence of these troops as soon as he was aware of the soultaking dangers that faced the inhabitants of Armageddon.<P><IMG SRC="Images/ripostetext.gif" HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=431  alt="Riposte"><br><IMG SRC="images/history_CHmarine.gif" HEIGHT=205 WIDTH=205 align="right">Only the special abilities possessed by the Grey Knights would be able to truly defeat a monstrosity such as Angron and they arrives just as the forces of Chaos pressed on towards Infernus and Helsreach hives. Teleporting themselves directly into the roiling mass of corruption and to the very feet of Angron himself the grey knights eventually defeated the daemon prince, banishing his tainted spirit back to the warp from whence he would not return for fully a hundred years.<p>In concert with this attack the Space Wolves launched a massive counter attack. The forces of Chaos were completely routed with only the World Eaters Chaos Space Marines making it back to the Devourer of Stars and thus the safety of the warp. The Imperial victory was complete and overwhelming but won at great cost.<CENTER><P><A HREF="http://www.games-workshop.com/front1.html"><img src="/armageddon3/Images/gwlogo.gif" width=250 height=47 border=0></a></P></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH="1" BGCOLOR="#FF0000" ALIGN=CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">.</FONT></P></TD><TD WIDTH="208" valign=top><CENTER><P><IMG SRC="Images/freetext1.gif" HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=208 alt="Free!
