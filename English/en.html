Rumors of his demise were shortlived as it became obvious that he was again preparing to invade Armageddon. The cunning greenskin was using this invasion as a test of both Armageddon's Imperial defenses and their military strategy. Now Ghazghkull has returned with a vengeance as sweeps all before him in a deadly green tide. Once again, the fate of a thousand worlds hangs precariously in the balance and billions of lives depend on the outcome of the coming Ork invasion.</P><P>The plan is cunningly simple - during the month of August, we want you to play as many games as possible of Warhammer 40,000, Epic 40,000 and Battlefleet Gothic! Send us your results and check out how your game has affected the campaign here on this website.</P><P>Whilst the campaign itself will start on July 31st, this site will be updated frequently to reflect the flow of the war, with extra material being added on a regular basis so you'll want to keep coming back for another look! The plan is for gamers across the world to get together and fight battles between Armageddon's defenders and the Ork invaders. As the results of your games pour in you'll be able to see how the war is going both in your own warzone and in the overall campaign. Suffice it to say, you should get painting in earnest because both sides will need bolstering as the struggle for supremacy begins!</P><P>Once the ash clouds of the burning hive cities and ruined Ork Gargants settle and all the results are in, we'll know the final outcome of the global campaign! Will Armageddon fall to the irresistible might of Ghazghkull and his horde? Will the valiant Imperial defenders and their allies stave off the greenskin invasion ensuring survival for billions of Imperial citizens? Or will the battle rage on and Armageddon become a world at war, an unrelenting battlefield, a world torn asunder? The simple answer is that it's in your hands! The more games you play, the more you'll be able to influence the final outcome!</P><P>To coincide with this gaming extravaganza, Games Workshop will be releasing <B>Codex: Armageddon.</B> This new Codex doesn't merely feature a single army as our other Codexes have. Oh no, it features four brand-new army lists. That's right FOUR army lists! It also features all of the background from past conflicts on Armageddon and detailed information on forces and famous (or infamous, depending on your viewpoint) individuals on both sides of the imminent Ork invasion. The army lists included in Codex Armageddon are <B>Salamanders Space Marines</b>, <B>Black Templars Space Marines</b>, <B>Ork Speed Freeks</B> and the <B>Armageddon Steel Legion</b>, a mechanized Imperial Guard regiment.</P><CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="RED"><B>WHAT NEXT?</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT></P></CENTER><P>An all-encompassing worldwide campaign, a new Codex, a set of brilliant new miniatures and still there's more!

He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods and the master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with the power of the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls die every day, for whom blood is drunk and flesh eaten. Human blood and human flesh - the stuff of which the Imperium is made.</P><P>To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. This is the tale of those times. It is a universe you can live in today - if you dare - for this is a dark and terrible era where you will find little comfort or hope.
