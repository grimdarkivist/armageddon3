I can now confirm Captain Heron's preliminary scouting observation Ð this hulk is indeed the <I>Tyrant Immortal</I>, as sighted by the Ultramarines nearly two hundred years ago in the Corribra Sector.  We may never ascertain how this ship managed to travel the huge distance between this system and Corribra, nor indeed how the Orks managed to wrest control from what the Ultramarines deemed to be an irrecoverable Genestealer infestation.  However, I was able to centre the auspices of the <I>Phobos</I> on to the hulk before we were forced to withdraw from its approaching escorts, which were formidable in number, to say the least.  My ship managed to obtain detailed information in this time, which I have forwarded on as Ref: Arm/00319661/DCL.  However, allow me to summarise here.</P><P>Our readings do not agree with the information we have from the Ultramarine's encounter, suggesting either they were in error or that the Orks have heavily modified the hulk.  I would tend to suspect the latter.</P><P>The displacement of the hulk has grown exponentially and proved very difficult for us to gauge accurately, but it is certainly in excess of four million tons.  A substantial increase in the power capacity of the vessel was obvious as its straight line speed could possibly match that of our slower capital ships, but it evidentially has severe manoeuvring problems, as witnessed first at St. Jowen's Dock when it seemed incapable of closing range with a target even as large as the station.  This would be somewhat consistent for a hulk of this massive size, but it would seem the <I>Tyrant Immortal</I> has acute problems in this area. We may pray to the Throne that it may prove to be incapable of achieving a stable orbit around Armageddon itself.</P><P>We could detect no evidence of the huge lance arrays that commonly feature on Ork hulks, but they may well be hidden amongst the great amount of surface clutter on the hull.  We had enough problems locating the launch bay exit tubes as they tended to be positioned in between the hulls of the ships that combine to make the hulk.  What is apparent are the huge amounts of weapons batteries that cover huge portions of the hull.  We were not able to witness them in operation, but I theorise that the <I>Tyrant Immortal</I> could easily hold its own against half a dozen of our first-line cruisers and suffer no more than minor damage.</P>  <P>The vessels escorting the hulk were great in number, with the escort sized ships beyond accurate counting.  There were, however, nine capital ships in close proximity, just as there were at the attack of St. Jowen's Dock, leading me to believe they have been permanently assigned to the <I>Tyrant Immortal</I>.  How this may change when the hulk reaches Armageddon, I cannot say as Ork fleet composition remains a mystery to me.</P><P>The sheer mass of the <I>Tyrant Immortal</I> could indicate a colossal amount of land based forces deep inside, ready for deployment on the surface of Armageddon, but our auspices were unable to penetrate that far into the hulk, a problem, incidentally, that the Ultramarines were confronted with, all those years ago.</P><P>It is my understanding that the <I>Tyrant Immortal</I> is but one of over a dozen hulks currently in-system.  It is my fond hope that the information I have managed to garner will allow us to finally defeat these monstrosities that have invaded our space.</P><P>Your obiedn't officer,</P><P ALIGN=RIGHT><I> - Captain Fennell, Phobos</I></P><CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT><B><A HREF="OrkSpaceHulk.html">Return to the Ork Space Hulk Stat Page</A></B><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT></P></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE><BR CLEAR><TABLE WIDTH=668 ALIGN=CENTER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 VALIGN=TOP BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/English/40KIntro/40Kintro.html"><IMG SRC="/Images/40Kbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/English/Campaign/campaign_map.html"><IMG SRC="/Images/campaignbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/English/Codex/codexarm.html"><IMG SRC="/Images/codexbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/English/History/history.html"><IMG SRC="/Images/historybutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/English/News/news.html"><IMG SRC="/Images/newsbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
