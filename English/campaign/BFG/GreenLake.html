When severely damaged or crippled in battle, the vast majority of Oberons are converted back into the Emperor-class, but the Green Lake has served with honour and distinction for as long as accurate records have been kept.</P><P>It is generally believed that the Green Lake was given its current name after the Tlaxian Conflict in the Sagartae Sector during the latter half of M35.  During that time, three squadrons of second line cruisers held back an Ork advance through Imperial space at the cost of their own destruction, during the Battle of the Green Lake Nebula.  The Green lake was named in honour of that desperate fight, though it is readily apparent that the battleship is much older even than this.  The crew of the Green Lake hold the belief that the Oberon was in service before the Emperor ascended to the Golden Throne and even that the vessel took part in the Battle of Terra, though such speculations are dismissed as fanciful.</P><P>During the initial stages of the Third Armageddon War, the Green Lake, under Captain Fitzmander, led a small fleet tasked with countering raids from Ork pirates throughout the sub sector.  The Green Lake had proved instrumental in driving Ork raiding fleets from Minerva, home of the famed Tank Legions, when the Astropaths on board began to tell of massed Ork formations attacking the Armageddon system itself.  Captain Fitzmander immediately ordered his fleet back to that world</P><P>His fleet entered the system after the fateful Defence of Pelucidar and the Green Lake immediately joined every other Imperial ship in dispersing throughout the system under Admiral Parol's orders. Along with the rest of the fleet, the Green lake began a series of hit and run attacks on the huge advancing wave of Ork ships, desperate to slow them down by any means available.  Of particular note is the risky action that led Captain Fitzmander and Tertius Draco squadron in a lightning slash against the eight Kapital ships of Warlord Snorkarr.  All eight ships were subsequently destroyed by this daring manoeuvre, for the loss of only the cruiser Deimos.  It was never ascertained which forces the Ork ships were carrying to Armageddon, but there is little doubt that there are many Space Marines and Guardsmen on that world that have good reason to be thankful for Fitzmander's gamble.</P><P>Since the battle, the Green Lake has been responsible for using its superior auspexes and sensor probes to track the Ork fleets as they spread throughout the system.  Though the Green Lake sees little actual combat now, the ancient vessel has become a centre for Imperial fleet operations around Armageddon, with Captain Fitzmander in near constant communication with Admiral Parol as he co-ordinates strikes upon isolated enemy ships and squadrons.  More than anything else, it is this solid organisation that has provided a strong back bone for Imperial ships, allowing them to whittle down the Ork fleet for few losses, as they wait for the day when major reinforcements finally arrive in-system.</P><CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT><B><A HREF="Oberon.html">Return to the Oberon Class Battleship Stat Page</A></B><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT></P></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE><BR CLEAR><TABLE WIDTH=668 ALIGN=CENTER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 VALIGN=TOP BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/40KIntro/40Kintro.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/40Kbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/Campaign/campaign_map.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/campaignbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/Codex/codexarm.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/codexbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/History/history.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/historybutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/News/news.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/newsbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
