As expected, the Orks have used considerable forces in their assault and though my ships have fought with valour and fortitude, the sheer strength of our enemy has forced us to retreat and regroup.</P><P>As you are aware, the fleet left St. Jowen's Dock in good order and initial skirmishes against the lead elements of the Ork fleet fully demonstrated the discipline of our well trained crews with over three score vessels falling to our guns without loss.  However, the Ork fleet, stretching over tens of thousands of kilometres, soon moved with haste towards our line and began a series of assaults that gradually battered our ships back.  The ferocity of these attacks was incredible and was, I fear, a portent of the tactics we may expect to see later as they move in-system.</P><P>It soon became clear that our situation was completely untenable and when the Battleship Triumph was crippled by a combined attack of five Kill Kroozers, I gave the order to withdraw.  I soon after received comm-bursts from monitor stations Yarrick and Mannheim reporting three more such fleets entering the system.  At this time, we are outnumbered and outgunned.</P><P>My clear objectives now are to first preserve my fleet for future battles and second, to delay the incoming Ork fleets as they move towards your own forces upon Armageddon itself.  To this end, we are mounting a series of hit and run attacks designed to pull Ork vessels from their main routes and waste time engaging our fleet.  My lighter cruisers and escorts are attempting to bypass the main part of the Ork fleets with the intention of attacking their rear, but initial reports from these squadrons suggest they are meeting fearsome resistance.</P><P>I am desperate for the promised reinforcements, for only then can I have any hope of seriously challenging the Ork's presence.  Emperor willing, they will arrive soon.  The transports carrying troops for your armies on Armageddon are still getting through, though we must expect a sharp increase in casualties as the Orks move further in-system.  I have had word that the 'Old Man' is due to arrive within days.  Needless to say, I will arrange a suitable escort to ensure his safe arrival.</P><P>Whatever plans these Orks have for Armageddon must be resisted with all our strength.  I need not remind you of the importance of Armageddon may prove to hold in the defence of the entire Imperium.</P><P>This is our darkest hour.  I pray for deliverance from this evil and trust in His divine light to shine upon us all.</P><P ALIGN=RIGHT><I> - Admiral Parol</I><P></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE WIDTH=668 ALIGN=CENTER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 VALIGN=TOP BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/40kintro/40kintro.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/40Kbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/Campaign/campaign_map.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/campaignbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/Codex/codexarm.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/codexbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/History/history.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/historybutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/News/news.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/newsbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
