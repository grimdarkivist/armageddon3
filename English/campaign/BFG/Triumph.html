Between the wars, the Triumph served as the flagship of the defence fleet under Captain Honyaeger and proved to be the bane of many pirate fleets keen to take advantage of any weakness in the Imperial Navy.  Amassing an impressive role of honour, the Triumph became the symbol of the Emperor's Will within the sub-sector.</P><P>When attacks on systems surrounding Armageddon started to drastically cut the amount of merchant shipping voyaging to the main system, the Triumph and other ships of the Imperial Navy found themselves stretched to breaking point.  There were simply too few ships to cover so much space and it was the merchant transports that were feeling the effect.  An appeal for reinforcements was met by the arrival of Admiral Parol on board His Will, accompanied by three first line cruiser squadrons.</P> <P>Acknowledging the Admiral's seniority and greater experience, Captain Honyaeger transferred command of the fleet to Parol and, for a short time, the depredations of the Ork pirates abated.</P><P>This all changed, almost overnight, as the piratical raids turned into full blown planetary assaults of several minor systems.  Within days, Monitor Station Dante broadcast an alert that an Ork fleet had entered the Armageddon system, before it was quickly silenced by the invaders.  The Armageddon fleet was placed on a state of full alert and, after patrolling squadrons had been recalled, the battleships His Will and Triumph led an attack force from St. Jowen's Dock of seven cruiser squadrons to intercept the Ork fleet.</P><P>Morale was reportedly very high amongst the crewmen of the Triumph, though Captain Honyaeger held few illusions as to the nature of the enemy they faced.  He knew the Imperial fleet was outnumbered by at least six to one and that the Orks could be a furious foe when attacking in numbers.  Within five days of leaving St. Jowen's Dock, the fleet met the lead elements of the Ork attackers, decoying enemy escorts with the battleships as the faster moving Imperial cruisers used Pelucidar's gravity well to swing around the Orks' flanks.</P><P>The Triumph and His Will worked in concert, combining their fearsome lance armament to create a lethal web of firepower that no Ork vessel could survive for long.  Over sixty enemy escorts were blasted apart for no loss on the Imperial side.  As more and more Ork ships joined battle though, combat devolved into a chaotic brawl of the sort Orks excel in.  As the bulk of the alien fleet moved further into the Armageddon system, the Imperial ships suffered greatly as the Orks' combined numbers and suicidal rushes threatened to overwhelm the Naval line.  The battlecruiser Thunderchild was the first to fall, its Captain bravely deciding to fight on whilst crippled rather than disengage, in order that the rest of his squadron could rally around the battleship His Will.</P><P>As more and more cruiser squadrons started to suffer losses, Admiral Parol ordered the Triumph to keep station so that the Imperial fleet had a stable rallying point. The Admiral took His Will forward to join the engagement of the first Ork Hulk to enter the pitched battle. Almost immediately, an over sized squadron of Kroozers took advantage of the break in the Imperial line and surged forward, taking little damage from His Will's long ranged broadside fire, before bracketing the Triumph and bombarding the Navy ship with massed fire.  Triumph's shields failed within seconds of this brutal attack and its ancient hull was soon battered by crude but heavy Ork weaponry. As the Kroozers moved closer to the battleship, a series of boarding attempts by attack craft and teleporters took the battle into the very heart of the Triumph, where its crewmen fought valiantly hand to hand against the Orks.  As crew were diverted from their main duties to fight the boarders, the Kroozers in the void outside found it easier to continue their bombardment of the increasingly sluggish Triumph, heedless of the lives of the Orks they had already sent to board the battleship.</P><P>Captain Honyaeger was pained by the onslaught his ship had suffered and reluctantly gave the order to disengage from combat, a feat he barely managed in his crippled vessel.  The fighting to clear the Ork boarders from his vessel reportedly took another four days to complete.</P><P>With the Triumph out of action and three more Ork fleets detected entering the Armageddon system, Admiral Parol was forced to disengage the remainder of his ships and regroup them to slow the Ork advance through Imperial space by any means he could.</P><P>The Triumph was able to effect temporary repairs and limped back to the fleet's main staging area, though the crippled battleship would clearly need several months in space dock before it could be once again declared battle worthy in any shape or form.  However, Captain Honyaeger was well aware that it would very likely be his duty to join combat again as the Orks flooded the system, even before the extensive repairs could take place.</P><CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT><B><A HREF="Apocalypse.html">Return to the Apocalypse Class Battleship Stat Page</A></B><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT></P></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE><BR CLEAR><TABLE WIDTH=668 ALIGN=CENTER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 VALIGN=TOP BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/40kintro/40Kintro.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/40Kbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/Campaign/campaign_map.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/campaignbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/Codex/codexarm.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/codexbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/History/history.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/historybutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/News/news.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/newsbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
