As we monitored the invasion of the Armageddon system by the four Ork fleets, we feared the worst for your defensive fleet.  You have my most sincere condolences for the great losses you suffered in your initial battle, but I am glad to be the bearer of what you will doubtless consider better tidings.  We have recently received a comm burst from the Triumph.  Though Captain Honyaeger reports that his ship was crippled in the battle, he managed to escape the ambush of Ork capital ships and has finally succeeded in eradicating all the boarders that fought their way into the heart of the Triumph.  Clearly, the deliverance of this, one of the rare Apocalypse-class Battleships, was the absolute Will of the divine Himself.</P><P>I must now report on our own situation here on St. Jowen's Dock.  As the Ork fleet swept past your line, we prepared for multiple boarding actions but, incredibly, the Orks opted for simple bombardment.  Few enemy vessels attempted orbit of our dock, preferring instead to simply unload ammunition into our hull as they continued their headlong rush towards Armageddon itself.  I feel that we were in no way a target for them Ð St. Jowen's Dock was just in their way.</P><P>Over ninety percent of our surface defences were destroyed in the first seven hours of the attack, negating our ability to strike back at the invaders.  Soon after, enemy assault boats were launched.  There was nothing co-ordinated in their assault and many of my bridge officers have formed the opinion that the many boarding craft that left the launch bays of passing Terror Ships were the result of poor discipline amongst the aliens.  Simply put, we believe we were finally boarded by Orks that could not wait long enough to reach Armageddon before engaging in battle.</P><P>With our defences all but nullified, we were powerless to stop them entering the Dock itself, but I organised combat teams to repel their assault with all haste.  We suffered heavy losses as the Orks fought with literally inhuman ferocity and the fighting that took place as the aliens pushed towards the main reactors was intense.  I was forced to divert many teams to aid in the defence of the reactors for fear that the Dock could be lost altogether if they succeeded in their attack, though this allowed many of their number to sweep unopposed through to some of our upper decks.  We now have the Orks somewhat under control, but we have lost almost all contact with the lower decks and must consider them enemy held territory.  We have the manpower to halt any further advance now that the fleets have moved passed us and begun their main assault, but we will never be able to clear the infestation unaided.</P><P>To this end, we are in much the same situation as yourself, unable to affect the Orks' plans in any great way until the promised Naval reinforcements arrive in-system.  Unfortunately we have no idea when this will be as Astropath Micaleo was killed during the first bombardments and thus we have no way of contacting fleets outside of the Armageddon system.  All I can suggest is that you try to hinder the Orks' assault by any method you are able until we receive the new squadrons.  For our part, we can hold the alien boarders at bay unless, Throne-forbid, another fleet arrives before our own reinforcements.  Regrettably, we can not offer any of your ships any facilities for repair or rearmament as these too have been destroyed by the Orks.</P><P>The bravery shown by my crew and your fleet cannot go unnoticed.  Surely it is the Emperor Himself that now guides our actions. As soon as our strength is mustered, we will drive the Orks from Armageddon.  And, at that time, His retribution will ensure they never return.</P><P>His Will be done.</P><P ALIGN=RIGHT><I> - Captain Starrkos</I></P></TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE WIDTH=668 ALIGN=CENTER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 VALIGN=TOP BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/40kintro/40kintro.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/40Kbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/Campaign/campaign_map.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/campaignbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/codex/codexarm.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/codexbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/History/history.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/historybutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/News/news.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/newsbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
