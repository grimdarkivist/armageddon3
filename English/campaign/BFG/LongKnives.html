Led by Squadron Leader Narch, the Long Knives were to see repeated combat as the Ork fleet rapidly approached the planet.</P><P>The first invaders to penetrate Armageddon's incredibly sophisticated orbital platform network were crude fighta-bommerz that had been charged with the destruction of all ground based defences. At first, few Ork craft managed to penetrate the massed laser and missile fire of the planetary defence forces and those that did were quickly destroyed by Thunderbolt squadrons, such as the Long Knives. As the Ork fleet arrived in orbit and started to demolish Armageddon's defences, however, the fighta-bommer attacks became almost constant. The Thunderbolt squadrons had the advantage of fighting over their homeland, so they were able to refuel and rearm within minutes and if they were forced to eject, they were certain to find friendly forces waiting for them. Though the Orks suffered tremendous casualties initially, the sheer weight of numbers of their craft, said to turn the sky black in some places, finally began to have an effect.</P><P>The initial Ork landings were concentrated around Armageddon's ground based defence silos and once these were destroyed, there was nothing that could stop the Ork invasion. A few reckless Imperial squadrons fought on, desperately trying to slow the Orks' attack, but most were forced to withdraw under the onslaught, only to find that Ork warriors had already overrun their air bases.</P><P>Leading the Long Knives, Narch flew his squadron across the Plains of Anthrand and hastily arranged a rendezvous with members of the Pioneer Corps who were able to prepare a temporary flight strip and refuel his craft. The limited communications provided by his Thunderbolts were enough to demonstrate just how the war was proceeding.  Imperial lines and defences were being smashed everywhere under the Orks' massive assaults and determined resistance outside of the Hives themselves had yet to be effectively actioned. Some Thunderbolt and Marauder squadrons had managed to fight their way clear of the fighta-bommer screens that were beginning to blanket the combat areas on Armageddon, and had managed to land in a few of the Hives, after taking serious losses. The situation looked desperate for the air forces on the planet.</P><P>The Long Knives have been using their limited amount of fuel and ammunition to strike at the ork warbands operating on the Plains of Anthrand, but it is a war they can never win. Without access to tech-priests and a constant supply of replacement parts, the front line Thunderbolt fighters are beginning to literally fall apart. Fuel, once taken for granted by the squadron, is now a precious resource and all the while the temporary flight strip is an extremely vulnerable target for any marauding warband that chances upon it. The primary targets of the Long Knives have been the warbands and fighta-bommerz that have strayed too close, but it can only be a matter of time before the operational centre of the Long Knives is discovered.</P><P>Squadron Leader Narch has sent many requests to the Imperial forces within Volcanus and Death Mire for a small armed force to be deployed around the flight strip for some measure of protection, as well a readily available supply of fuel and other necessities. So far, no response has been received and Narch is no longer sure if his long ranged communications are even working properly. Cut off, without any hope of reinforcement or supply, the pilots of the Long Knives fly their last few missions, knowing that even if the Orks do not shoot them out of the sky, the lack of fuel will soon ground them and leave the entire squadron defenceless against the first warband that discovers them.</P><CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT>Click <A HREF="FlightLog.html">here</A> to view Squadron Leader Narch's Flight Log<FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT></P></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE><BR CLEAR><TABLE WIDTH=668 ALIGN=CENTER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 VALIGN=TOP BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/40kintro/40kintro.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/40Kbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/campaign/campaign_map.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/campaignbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/codex/codexarm.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/codexbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/History/history.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/historybutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/News/news.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/newsbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
