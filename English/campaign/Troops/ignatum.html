Deployed in the wastelands outside Volcanus Hive, the powerful might of the Legio's many battle titans was seen as a bulwark against any Ork attack.  The Legio Ignatum had a long and proud history, with six truly ancient titans having fought within the Emperor's Palace during the final stages of the Horus Heresy.  The greatest of these was the Warmonger-class titan, the Imperious Prima, a machine forged in distant times before the formation of the Imperium itself and present to drive the Legio Mortis from Terra, ten millennia previous.<p>Granted command of the entire Legio in battle, the Princeps of the Imperious Prima, Milar Boitanus, led his titans in several engagements against the warbands that lay siege to Volcanus Hive, meeting with great success on the field.  Veterans of a thousand wars, the titans of Legio Ignatum fought with a holy fury against the Ork invaders of Armageddon and, with the help of the Astartes Chapter Iron Champions, successfully relieved the remnants of the Celestial Lions who had borne the brunt of the aliens' attacks outside the Hive.<p>When Despot Gazgrim broke off from the continuing siege of Volcanus to attack the Legio directly, Princeps Boitanus gladly gave battle, giving in to the Imperious Prima's desire for total war.  The citizens of Volcanus were to witness the unleashing of colossal energies as titan fought against gargant in a pitched battle that could decide the fate of the entire Hive.<P>Massed squadrons of Ork fighta-bommerz flooded the sky above Volcanus, blotting out the sun as they bombarded the Legio Ignatum whilst they advanced with continuous strafing runs.</font>	</td><td valign=top width=225 ><table align=center><font size=0><tr><td colspan=2><font color="#FF0000" size=+2><center>Adeptus Mechanicus</center></font></td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Centurio Ordinatus</td><td align=right><font size=0>4 Ordinatus</td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Legio Crucius</td><td align=right><font size=0>Demi-Legio</td></tr><tr><td><font size=0><a href="ignatum.html">Legio Ignatum</A></td><td align=right><font size=0>Legio</td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Legio Invigilata</td><td align=right><font size=0>Legio</td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Legio Magna</td><td align=right><font size=0>Quarto-Legio</td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Legio Metalica</td><td align=right><font size=0>Demi-Legio</td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Legio Tempestor</td><td align=right><font size=0>	Legio</td></tr><tr><td><font size=0><a href="victorium.html">Legio Victorum</a></td><td align=right><font size=0>	Legio</td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Skitarii</td><td align=right><font size=0>14 Regiments</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><font color="#FF0000" size=+2><center>Departmento Munitorium</center></font></td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Engineer Corps</td><td align=right><font size=0>2</td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Pioneer Corps</td><td align=right><font size=0>1</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><font color="#FF0000" size=+2><center>Adeptus Arbites</center></font></td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Precincts</td><td align=right><font size=0>20</td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Punitive Battalions</td><td align=right><font size=0>12</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><font color="#FF0000" size=+2><center>Officio Assassinorum</center></font></td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Agents	</td><td align=right><font size=0>Classified Information</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><font color="#FF0000" size=+2><center>Officio Sabatorum</center></font></td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Agents</td><td align=right><font size=0>34</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><font color="#FF0000" size=+2><center>Ordo Xenos</center></font></td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Kill-Teams</td><td align=right><font size=0>2</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><font color="#FF0000" size=+2><center>Templars Psykologis</center></font></td></tr><tr><td><font size=0>Disruption Squads</td ><td align=right><font size=0>15</td></tr></font></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2 ><br><font color="#00ff00" size=+1>Several Warlord-class titans opened up with their carapace weaponry to bring down huge numbers of the enemy craft, but they could not stop the destruction of two scout titans and the general weakening of the Legio's void shields. Too late, Princeps Boitanus saw the method in Gazgrim's preliminary attack as the eighteen huge gargants of his war horde closed range and opened fire. Already drained by the fighta-bommer attack runs, the void shields of many titans soon gave way under the incredible firepower of Gazgrim's war machines, whilst their fully charged power fields resisted the Imperials' response.<p>For six hours, the battle raged, with Macro Cannon and heavy laser fire blasting apart gargants, even as the Legio Ignatum's titans began to die, one by one.  Several gargants rushed forward, seemingly eager to bring the Imperial machines down with the crude close combat weaponry they sported, only to be methodically destroyed by disciplined Imperial counter fire.  Steadily, though, the gargants' ability to resist damage, combined with the Legios' weakened shields began to alter the course of the entire battle.<p>The Imperious Prima was immobilised by Ork gatling weapons impacting upon its main power conduits almost as soon as its last void shield overloaded and shut down.  Unable to move his ancient war machine, Princeps Boitanus watched as, all around, his titans began to give ground to the gargants that greatly outnumbered them.  Over-charging his primary weapons, he ordered the retreat of the Legio Ignatum and, initiating attacks on several nearby gargants, made his peace with the Emperor as he prepared to cover their withdrawal.<p>Several Princeps of the Legio could not, or would not, will their titans to retire from battle and these men were to witness the fall of the Imperious Prima as what little else remained of the Legio pulled back.  Surrounded by gargants, the Imperious Prima took punishing damage from all sides until a well aimed Gutbuster shell tore through the knee actuators of its left leg.  For scant seconds, the colossal Warmonger stayed upright as its meagre stabilising jets burnt themselves out, but there was no force in the galaxy that could prevent the fall of such a huge machine.  The Imperious Prima buckled on its left leg, then toppled forward, the impact of its gigantic hull crashing to the ground resounding all around the Volcanus warzone.  The few remaining Imperial titans soon joined the Imperious Prima's demise as Gazgrim's victorious forces advanced across a battlefield littered with blasted ruins, shattered titans and cooling lakes of liquid glass created by the tremendous energies of the battle.<p>Now making barely a Quarto-Legio, the surviving titans of Ignatum are shameful of their failure in the battle that could have liberated Volcanus Hive so early in the war.  The loss of the Imperious Prima, the greatest titan of the Legio, is a heavy blow and one that they may never fully recover from.  The remainder of the Legio Ignatum have since been re-deployed along the South Primus Front to support the Legios Victorum and Tempestor who have themselves suffered heavy losses upon the Plains of Anthrand.</font></td></tr></table><BR CLEAR><TABLE WIDTH=668 ALIGN=CENTER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 VALIGN=TOP BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/English/40KIntro/40Kintro.html"><IMG SRC="/Images/40Kbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/English/Campaign/campaign_map.html"><IMG SRC="/Images/campaignbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/English/Codex/codexarm.html"><IMG SRC="/Images/codexbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/English/History/history.html"><IMG SRC="/Images/historybutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/English/News/news.html"><IMG SRC="/Images/newsbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>		</body>	</html>
