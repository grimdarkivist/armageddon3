If we had known how things were going to be then we would never have surrendered. Of the two hundred I'm the only one lived. Still you don't want to know how I stayed alive you want to know about Kroksnik. Well he was  a maverick all right, with only about 20 Orcs behind him he strutted around like he owned the place, him and Jaggit were always keeping a wary eye on each other. Jaggit was number one though and would probably still be but for Kroksnik. <p>Kroksnik followed Jaggit out of camp one night. He came back alone. There were a couple of dissenting voices but Kroksnik soon shut them up, I don't know what he said but it involved shaking that Power Claw of his a lot. So that was it  -  Kroksnik was in charge, what's more he noticed I was paying attention and remembered me. Oh yes he remembered me, Kroksnik had a pet see, a vile sack of pus and razor sharp teeth that the Orks call a Squig and he made it my job to look after it. So that meant I was always a few feet from Kroksnik ready to take charge of two foot of hissing, biting, lunatic attack squig whenever he wanted. The Squigs food was better than the slaves though so I did a swop, didn't do the vicious little brute no harm though more's the pity. <p>Kroksnik was on the way up, after getting rid of Jaggit he was the top boy in the mob which consisted about sixty Orks and two Skullhammas. The Skullhamma is a Battle Fortress, bigger than a tank it is literally an Ork fortress on tracks, rollers and wheels. Its got guns everywhere and the Orks love to hang off the outside while it roars along.  As I picked up the language I realised that most bosses can't wait to get their hands on a Gargant, which is a great big titan thing built to look like an Ork.</td><td valign=top width=250 ><center><CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT><font color="#FF0000" size=+2>ARMAGEDDON SECUNDUS</font><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT></P></CENTER><font color="#FF0000" size=+2><center>Forces of the Ork Warlord Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka</center></font><br><font color="#FF0000"><b><A HREF="multiork.html">Great Overlord Ghazghkull's War Horde<br>(Estimated 400 warbands, 18 Gargants)</a></b></font><p><font color="#FF0000"><b><A HREF="morfang.html">Warlord Morfang's Gargant Big Mob<br>(Estimated 6 warbands, 7 Gargants)</a></b></font><p>Warlord Skarfang's Gargant Big Mob<br>(Estimated 3 warbands, 6 Gargants)<p>Warlord Burzuruk's Gargant Big Mob<br>(Estimated 4 warbands, 9 Gargants)<p><font color="#FF0000"><A HREF="kroksnik.html"><b>Warlord Kroksnik's Deth Traks<br> (Estimated 4 warbands, 32 Battle Fortresses)</b></a></font><p>Blackskull Tribe<br>(Estimated 30 warbands, 3 Gargants)<p><A HREF="multiork.html">Crooked Moon Tribe<br>(Estimated 21 warbands, 5 Gargants)</a><p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Red Fin Tribe<br>(Estimated 30 warbands, 4 Gargants)</b></font><p>Red Wheelz Speed Freeks<br>(Estimated 18 'Speed Kult' warbands)<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Burning Death Speed Freeks<br>(Estimated 25 'Speed Kult' warbands)</b></font><p><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT><A HREF="thugsniks_big_gunz.html">Warlord Thugsnik's Big Gunz<br>(Estimated 6 'artillery' warbands)</A><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT></P><p><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT><A HREF="morbads_big_gunz.html">Warlord Morbad's Big Gunz<br>(Estimated 12 'artillery' warbands)</A><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT><p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><font color="#00FF00" size="+1"> Kroksnik was different though, you should have seen him when the Jugga - that's the name of his Skullhamma by the way - was going full pelt over the sandstone flats. He was just so blissed you could have taken an axe to him and he wouldn't have known. One of the boyz said that Kroksnik was a 'Bad Moon Bikeboy' once and had been involved in a collision with a Battle Fortress that came out of nowhere. Since then 'coming out of nowhere' was what Kroksnik did.<p>Boss Kroksnik's first war was with the Green Fang tribe, a bunch of Deth Skull rabble led by Boss Jompokk aboard his Gargant 'Klankiller'. Kroksnik's Battle Fortress mob was part of a loose group called the Slicerz. The Slicerz were a desperate collection of Speed Freeks who wanted to blast a path through Green Fang territory.<p>The Slicerz bikes and buggies soon herded the Green Fang infantry into a circle around Klankiller. The Gargants roaring cannon combined with the Lootas began to take a heavy toll of the Slicerz though. Kroksnik's  Skullhamma's. roared forward. I was in the command cabin a discrete five feet behind everyone with a big sack of squig snacks, a thick leather glove and a few kegs of an absolutely undrinkable Ork beverage called Fungus ale. Believe me if it had been anything like ale I would have drank it.<p>As the Jugga charged forward I saw a huge cannonball roar just over the cabin although judging by the scream it took someone with it. The shot was from the Gargant  but it couldn't get a proper angle on us because there was a ridge between us and it. The cabin had about three Orks and four Grots and when the shooting started they all went mental, Kroksnik was 'hoooo-hooo'ing', his massive shoulders rising and falling, the Ork driver was biting his own tongue bloody, the mekaniak was bouncing up and down banging a wrench on the deck. One grot was hanging off the back of the drivers seat, another was sticking its head out of the window, the other two were swinging around a vertical grab-pole screaming their lungs out. <p>Kroksnik turned around and thrust his Squig into my arms 'for safe-keepin'.  Before I could get a smaller squig from the sack to keep it entertained it had wrapped itself around my neck and half-bitten through my ear. I fell against the hull and banged my head just in time to see the ridgeline coming up fast. The Skullhamma's crested the ridge some 100 paces from the Gargant their rollers and tracks leaving the ground. I spun dizzily around, the cacophony in the cabin got louder and the Squig detached itself to crawl under some machinery, then the 200 ton fortress hit the ground. I bounced, up at first then down, unable to keep my balance I grovelled on the steel floor my jaw lolling. Ahead of me was some device for plotting location, as I looked at it Kroksnik's Squig came slithering out from under it displaying all three rows of teeth. I got my gloved hand up and rolled backwards past the cabin door. Glancing out I could see that the Fortresses leap had narrowly cleared the encircling Slicerz but had landed full square on the  Deth Skulz crushing dozens judging by the gorey mess splashed all over the place. In a flash. Kroksnik, was in front of me roaring in sheer pleasure taking a pot-shot with some kind of missile launcher through the door. He casually grabbed the Squig in his power claw and with remarkable dexterity held it by its neck until I could safely grab it - he then clipped me with the claw and I fell over again. <p>Clutching the Squig I braced myself in a corner as the fortress slewed around and saw what was going on. Each fortress raced around a different side of the Gargant their cannons pounding at it from close range, inside it's power fields the guns tore great holes in the thick plate armoured belt. Klankiller tried to strike back but its guns had trouble tracking us at this speed and did immense damage to those Deth Skulz that hadn't been crushed under our wheels. Seeing a rent open in the armour on the Gargants right side Kroksnik seized the controls battering his unfortunate driver aside and hurled the Fortress at the gap. I took advantage of the unconcious driver to slip Kroksnik's Squig into his jerkin where the warmth might calm it down and got ready to jump clear. I was too slow though and the Fortress hit the Gargant, already weakened by the gunfire the Gargant opened like a ripe fruit and Jugga collided messily with its knee joint mechanism wrecking it completely. I was in two minds whether to get out, lots of Kroksniks boys were. already out fighting the Gargant crew but I was sure one of my ribs was bust and stayed put, taking advantage of the stop to fish out a small albino squig with which to entertain the Boss' attack Squig. It  took the albino squig and tried for my gloved fingers and then just lay there while it digested. Kroksnik and his mekaniak had been arguing but that seemed over. Using the flat of his choppa to slam Jugga into reverse Kroksnik fired the forward grapple so it wrapped itself around the Gargant's knee joint. With a scream of protesting metal the fortress tore itself free of the Gargant, out of the fumes and blinding smoke.  Jugga kept going, the grapple cable suddenly came taunt and the fortress jerked to a halt. Its wheels spun, the engine whined and I could see the Gargants guns swiveling around to us. Kroksnik bellowed with glee, and jammed his foot down hard on the fasta pedal while yanking recklessly on the red lever. The weakened leg of the Gargant could take no more, a three ton lump of gears and servos came loose and the Jugga surged backwards towing the scrap after it. The Gargant's guns impotently raked the ground where we had been, the recoil from its weapons pushing it slowly and inexorably backwards. Unable to balance the Gargant collapsed and was instantly swallowed by flame as its ammunition exploded. The blast finished off the remains of the Green Fangs and from all corners of the battlefield Slicerz mekboys leapt from their buggies grasping their tools to grab what scrap they could. Before they could help themselves Jugga roared to a halt in front of the fallen Gargant. Kroksnik's boyz were hanging off the sides, shootas ready while he stood in the cabin doorway. 'I fink you orta know', he said slowly before gesturing at the wreckage, 'I saw it first'. <p>I didn't see Kroksnik much after that, he linked up with some even bigger Ork called Ghazghkull, I got sent to an abandoned mine in the Piscinan Belt that the Orks were  doing up as a base. I'd been there a good few months in one of their infernal workshops when the Harbinger Space Marines arrived and liberated me. All the time I was with the Orks though I never met one that was more dangerous than Kroksnik. Living and dying are nothing to him and he thinks fast. If he's on Armageddon you've got problems. </font><font color="#FF0000" size=+2><center>Threat evaluation - Kroksnik's Deth Traks</center></font> <P ALIGN=LEFT><font color="#FFFFFF" size="+1">This tale from Kroksnik's militarily formative years whilst doubtless elaborated by Penitent Grey shows an imaginative use of battle fortresses. Lacking the power fields to shoot it out Kroksnik uses dead ground to get close and then initiates an assault which although still exceptionally risky allows him a warriors chance in close. This tactic was doubtless a complete surprise to the Gargant Captain. All Princeps on Armageddon commanding Titans of Reaver displacement or less should be briefed on this tactic. <p>Speed is the essence of Kroksnik's tactics. Against conventional infantry and armour he is aware that he can ignore their firepower for a time so he will commonly drive straight through an Imperial Guard formation, race around behind the lines until it begins to get too hot then return to his own lines. Battle Fortresses can stay in the field longer than Gargants, are easier on the crews and are more reliable as they are simply big battlewagons. When the Deth Traks are identified it is essential that mobile armoured formations with air support are on stand-by for pursuit and interception duties.<p>It is known that the warbands accompanying the Deth Traks consist primarily of foot mobs well equipped with heavy and customised weaponry who ride on the fortresses. These are augmented by outriders in light vehicles. During the encirclement of Hive Infernus Kroksnik used his outriders to draw the 17th Armageddon Steel Legion further into the ash wastes before pinning them with his well-armed foot mobs so that his fortresses could cut them off and destroy them with ease.  All units are therefore to be alerted to the use of feigned flight by the Deth Traks. <p>In considering the Ork invasion of Armageddon it is easy to focus on the semi-mythical Ghazghkull and presume the rest of the Ork nobility  to be compliant minions incapable of strong independent action. This is a bad oversight because whilst Ghazghkull is the predominant Ork Warlord there are many others close behind him who are equally dangerous. The evident care Ghazghkull has taken in selecting his lieutenants is testament to this. <p>Mhagdhash Kur Kroksnik, commander of the Deth Traks is a major threat and should be treated accordingly.</font><font color="#FF0000" size=+2><center>Using the Deth Traks in Warhammer 40K and Epic 40K.</center></font> <P ALIGN=LEFT><font color="#00FF00" size="+1">The defining thing about Kroksnik's Deth Traks is their Battle Fortresses and these do not feature in Warhammer 40K (yet...). What you could do though is build an army representing Kroksnik's boyz after they have dismounted to fight on foot. There are plenty of places where even Kroksnik's insane drivers cannot go but that doesn't mean the Deth Traks won't get stuck in. This type of force will be a blend of fast buggies and bike outriders backed up by heavily armed foot mobs toting plenty of big gunz. You would of course also be able to field Mhagdhash Kur Kroksnik himself complete with Power Claw, Rokkit Launcha and Attack Squig.<p>The Deth Traks really come into their own in Epic 40K though where up to a dozen of the mighty battle fortresses can be crow-barred into the same army. An Ork Epic 40K army may use Kroksnik as its Warlord. If they do then he must be mounted in a battle fortress and confers a 4+ save against each hit inflicted on it as well as providing the normal supreme commander advantages. If Kroksnik is the supreme Ork commander then there must be at least 4 battle fortresses for each 1000 points in the army and Gargants may NOT be used.</font></td></tr></table><BR CLEAR><TABLE WIDTH=668 ALIGN=CENTER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 VALIGN=TOP BORDER=0><TR><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/40KIntro/40Kintro.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/40Kbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/Campaign/campaign_map.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/campaignbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/Codex/codexarm.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/codexbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/History/history.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/historybutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD WIDTH="17" ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/invisiblenav.gif" HEIGHT=17 WIDTH="17"></TD><TD WIDTH="120" ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF="/armageddon3/English/News/news.html"><IMG SRC="/armageddon3/Images/newsbutton.gif" HEIGHT=24 WIDTH="120" BORDER=0></A></TD></TR></TABLE></td></tr></table>		</body>	</html>
