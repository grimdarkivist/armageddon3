<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">By now you'll be familiar with the bloody history of Armageddon and the long wartorn past its inhabitants have struggled to live through. Ghazghkull's return to Armageddon means more than just an opportunity to recount the details of a massive Ork invasion and the mustering of dozens of Space Marine chapters, hundreds of Imperial Guard regiments, full Titan Legions and countless other Imperial defence forces. It means more than the chance to produce some excellent artwork and superbly sculpted miniatures. More even than the new Codex Armageddon itself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">It gives us the opportunity to run a gargantuan worldwide gaming event the like of which the world has never seen before! The plan is remarkably simple - during the month of August we want you all to play as many games of Warhammer 40,000, Epic 40,000 and Battlefleet Gothic as possible! Each game you play will then count towards the final outcome and decide the fate of a thousand planets! The campaign will go something like this: </FONT></P>

<OL>
<P><LI>Starting on 1st August, play a game of Warhammer 40,00, Epic 40,000 or Battlefleet Gothic.</LI></P>
<P><li> Register your results at either Ghazghkull's Kommand Gargant or the Imperial High Command war room (or by regular post with the form found in White Dwarf 248 and 249).</li></P>
<P><li> The database will be accepting results until 8th September. At this point we'll be able to see how each warzone has fared and judge how the war has gone for both sides.</li></P>
</OL>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">We will be assigning each country or continent a specific warzone, which is centred on a key feature on the map of Armageddon. For instance the Infernus warzone is centred on Hive Infernus and will be fought over by anyone living in the UK while gamers in New Zealand will be fighting for Warzone Phoenix, centred on Phoenix Island.</FONT></P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="images/campaignhowtext.gif" HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=190 ALT="How do I Join In?"></P></CENTER>

<p><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Then when you've finished each battle you can simply register your results on this website and play your part in the struggle for control of the strategically vital Armageddon sub-sector. Every result, be it by email or regular post will appear on the results section situated on this website so you'll be able to drop in and review your previous games or check out those of other gamers. The results page will also give a running total of how many games have been played, how many points of troops have taken part and most importantly of all who has won the most games - the Ork side or the Imperial.</FONT></P>

<p><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">It doesn't end there though as Games Workshop stores across the world, and selected independent stockists will be running special games, tours and other exciting events and these games will also go towards the overall campaign - keep an eye on White Dwarf magazine for details! That's not all - we also want to hear from individual gamers, clubs, etc. So, if your local club is planning a suitably impressive gaming event or even if you and your friends are just planning to play a few games over a weekend we want to hear about how it went as we'll be publishing the best of these in a future issue of White Dwarf!</FONT></P>

<p><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Of course, it doesn't matter if your battlefield is set up for fighting in say the jungle but you are fighting in a warzone which is predominantly of another terrain type (Asia and South America fight over the Equatorial Jungle for instance). A visit to your warzones page will show you a more detailed view of your zone and will incorporate most terrain types in some form. Featuring all the important geographical and strategic features in the war zone you'll be able to base many of your games around these features and even allocate your battles to them!</FONT></P>

<p><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">By far and away the over-riding principle behind this campaign is for everyone to play lots of games of Warhammer 40,000, Epic 40,000 and Battle fleet Gothic as possible in a month and in the process try to help win your countries warzone for your side be it Ork or Imperial!</FONT></P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="images/campaignwhichtext.gif" HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=288 ALT="Which Armies Can Fight?"></P></CENTER>

<p><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The 3rd War for Armageddon is primarily a conflict between the multitudinous hordes of the Ork invaders and the stalwart combined defence forces of the Imperium.  However the 41st millennium is a place of war, of death and of aliens so it would be unthinkable that other races wouldn't be embroiled into this colossal war.</FONT></P>

<p><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The Orks are known to have made use of Chaos Space Marine contingents and Dark Eldar pirates are always keen to take new slaves are thus more than willing to ally with the greenskins. The enigmatic Eldar are a law unto themselves as they have been seen to aid both sides, even clashing with other Eldar forces! All this combined with an increasing number of Tyranid Hive fleets being sighted in this area of the galaxy (Hmmm, I wonder why...) and you can see that pretty much anyone can take part in this all-encompassing campaign.</FONT></P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="images/campaignwhattext.gif" HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=219 ALT="What Happens At The End Of August?"></P></CENTER>

<p><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">On Monday September 4th all warzones will cease to accept results. This doesn't mean you can't carry on playing games just that they won't count towards your warzone.</FONT></P>

<p><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Then, once the ash clouds of the burning hive cities finally clears and the last of the results are entered into the database we'll know the final outcome of the biggest wargaming campaign ever! Will Armageddon fall to the irresistible might of Ghazghkull's Ork hordes? Will the hard-pressed and seriously outnumbered Imperial defenders stave off the alien invaders and ensure this vital sub-sector remains in Imperial hands? Or will the war rage on with neither side completely victorious making Armageddon a world at war, an unrelenting battlefield, a world torn apart by eternal conflict? The more games you win for your side the better as only you can influence the final outcome!</FONT></P>
