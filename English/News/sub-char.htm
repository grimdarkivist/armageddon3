At Infernus he fought hand-to-hand in the trenches, taking             a slugga round in the chest yet fighting on until the attack was driven             off. In the west he led the hive militia into the breach of the fortress             on Volcanus Mountain, and at Death Mire he fought alongside the Mordians             across the Phlegethon Bridge. On Armageddon, Yarrick was the Imperium             and the Imperium was Yarrick. As the war ground into bloody stalemate,             word reached him that his nemesis had left Armageddon to strike elsewhere.             In the war room of Hive Infernus Yarrick gathered his warriors around             him and swore that he would pursue Ghazghkull to the ends of the galaxy             if need be, formally passing command of the military council back             to General Kurov. High Marshal Helbrecht of the Black Templars declared             that he would join Yarrick in his holy crusade and by nightfall the             'Old Man's' quest had begun.</font> </TD>          <td valign=TOP width="220"><font color="#00FF00">Current data on the             Beast of Armageddon is far from exact to say the least and the many             conflicting reports differ wildly in their conclusions. Some say his             body lies dead on the battlefield and certainly there are many who             claim that honour, though none can produce a corpse to verify such             boasts. Some claim he was never even on Armageddon, that another Ork             boss assumed his name to take control of the Waaagh! Several officers             of the Imperial Navy point to the departure of an Ork hulk codified             as the Perversion of Pain, long suspected to have been Ghazghkull's             command hulk, as evidence that the warlord has departed Armageddon.             With almost every other world throughout the sector dangerously weakened             by Armageddon's drain on the Imperium's military resources, some even             suggest that this may have been part of the Beast's plan all along.             However this presupposes a level of cunning and intelligence that             most Imperial scholars dismiss as unthinkable. </font></td>          <TD VALIGN=top>             <div align="left"><font color="#00FF00">At this time little is known               of the fate of Herman Von Strab, the infamous despot responsible               for the betrayal of the entire hive to the Orks. The only sign of               his presence found in Acheron itself was a selection of pre-recorded               messages being broadcast from the inner palace. It is rumoured that               Von Strab was among those who fled to the underhive and a mission               by the 'Last Chancers' penal regiment has been sent into the lower               sumps in an effort to capture him.

That it should come to this... comrades in arms locked in a battle         to the death. Then he saw him, his brother once, his enemy now.

He swallowed and ran his tongue         over his teeth, fighting down the visions. But no matter how hard he pushed         them away, they were always there, lurking at the back of his skull. Brother         Captain Erasmus Tycho stood and turned to leave the chapel, stopping as         he saw Chaplain Lemartes standing in the archway, his face shrouded in         the dancing shadows cast by the electro-flambeaux.<br>        "Were you seeing them again?" asked Lemartes.<br>        Tycho nodded slowly. "Yes..." he whispered, "I see them even now. I can         feel his pain, it burns me."<br>        Lemartes approached Tycho and placed his hands on his friend's shoulders.         He had always known it would come to this, but still he felt sorrow. Fitting         that it should come on Armageddon. He could see Tycho's glassy eyed stare         and knew that part of his mind was no longer here in the now, but had         been wrenched back to the time of the Great Betrayal. To the last battle         of their Primarch Sanguinius. To his death. </font>      <p> <font color="#00FF00">"Have they considered my... request?" asked Tycho.<br>        "They have, my friend," replied Lemartes sadly. <br>        "And?" <br>        "You shall have your wish, Erasmus. The honour of leading the forlorn         hope into the Tempestora breach on the morrow is yours.

The first men to die. He felt his         pulse race and his breathing quicken<b>... The Imperial palace was in         ruins, thousands were dead...</b> He blinked and watched as vast bellied         Gargants<b>....

His Emperor had made the         decision to take the fight to Horus and Sanguinius of the Blood Angels         would not fail him... Chaplain Lemartes stopped before Tycho and dipped         his finger into a blood filled chalice. He anointed Tycho's helmet with         blood in the form of a jagged saltire and said, "With my blood I commend         your soul to the Emperor. May he watch over you this day." <br>        "And you also Dorn," said Tycho, taking Lemartes' hand in the warriors         grip, wrist to wrist. "One last time brother."<br>        "Yes," agreed Lemartes, knowing that Tycho was finally lost to him. "One         last time." </font></p>      <center>        <p><font color="#00FF00"><b>*****</b> </font></p>      </center>      <p><font color="#00FF00">Tycho smashed another Greenskin from the rubble         with a backhanded sweep of his fist. Bones cracked and blood sprayed.         The top of the breach was less than ten metres away. Gunfire stitched         a path towards him, spurts of dust and stone exploding around him. He         felt the powerful impacts, but ignored them, charging up the debris strewn         slope. Choking dust and smoke filled the air. All he could see were shadowy         forms before him<b>... brother Space Marines, their oaths of loyalty ashes         in the dust. He hated them like nothing he had ever hated before. A blade         swung at his head, striking his shoulder guard and tearing upwards...</b>         Tycho's golden mask tore from his rictus face in a wash of blood and skin.         He screamed in fury, standing at the top of the breach, surrounded by         his foes. The Orks swarmed around the Blood Angels, dying by the dozen         as fifty years of hatred and vengeance poured through Tycho's veins. Behind         him, the last Space Marine of the forlorn hope fell beneath the blades         of the Orks<b>... the others were gone, separated in the teleportation.         He was alone…</b> Tycho fought with the strength of legend, fighting and         killing all who came near him. He swept up a fallen sword and continued         the slaughter, the blade rising and falling, Ork blood sheathing its edge.         No blade could pierce his armour, no bullet could lay him low. Ork corpses,         scores deep, surrounded him, his altar of death. The smoke parted and         a massively powerful Ork, clad in wheezing mechanical armour, crunched         across the rubble towards him. Black exhaust fumes belched from rusted         pipes and enormous claws snapped from each arm. Tycho snarled as the unquenchable         fury of the Black Rage finally consumed him utterly... </p><p><b>Horus, greatest         and most beloved of the Primarchs. Why? When we could have achieved anything         we dreamed of, why? Horus said nothing, swinging with his bladed fist.         He sprang away from the powerful claw, spinning behind the Traitor. Sanguinius         leapt feet first at Horus, feeling fangs break under his boot heels. He         landed lightly, rolling swiftly to his feet as Horus attacked again. His         back was to the wall, nowhere to go but forwards. The two brothers met         blade to blade and Sanguinius knew he could not defeat Horus. The sword         snapped and Horus smashed the claw through his armour and deep into his         belly. Excruciating agony ripped upwards into his ribcage as Horus tore         his heart out. Sanguinius spat blood into his brother's face and hissed,         "I die, but you will die with me, traitor!" as he lashed out with his         fist and ripped out his foe's throat in a welter of blood. He felt Horus'         grip slacken and slumped to the ground, his lifeblood pumping from his         broken body. He could vaguely hear his companions calling his name, but         with each second their voices grew dimmer. He had not failed his Emperor.         He smiled and closed his eyes as life slipped away.</b> </font></p>      <p align="center"><font color="#00FF00"><b>*****</b> </font></p>      <p><font color="#00FF00">Lemartes watched the small group of Space Marines         as they bore their Captain on their shoulders towards the Imperial lines.         The breach had fallen and the outer ring of fortifications and bunkers         were now in Imperial hands. Tycho had held the breach long enough for         the rest of the army to reach the walls and carry the day. With a tenderness         that belied the gore-streaked appearance of the Blood Angels, they laid         Brother Captain Erasmus Tycho at the feet of Chaplain Lemartes. He knelt         by the bloody corpse, laying a hand on his brow and staring at his friend's         face. Perhaps it was just the relaxation of muscle that followed death,         but he believed he could see a softening in Tycho's features, as though         the terrible disfigurement done to him had retreated within his flesh.         He hoped so. <br>        "Farewell brother," he whispered.
