Hot ash storms have grounded all air power and rendered orbital bombardments all but useless. Lava flows have separated battle zones and front  lines into an uncertain maze.  A period of uneasy calm has fallen across the embattled    planet. Both sides now have a chance to regroup and rearm, lick wounds     and build fortifications before the onset of the cooler    Season of Shadows enables the whole dreadful death machine to roll     into action once more. In space, newly arrived Imperial ships have      driven back the Ork armada, enabling convoys of desperately needed      reinforcements to reach the embattled hives.</center><p><IMG SRC="images/yarrick.gif" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="144" ALIGN="LEFT">The Imperium has held Ghazghkull's great Waaagh! - just. Terrible         sacrifices have been made, fearsome battles fought and the combined might         of Imperial Guard, Titan Legions and Space Marines committed to a dreadful         cauldron of fire and destruction unseen in Segmentum Solar since the dark         days of the Age of Apostasy. Even so it has barely been enough - shattered         hives remain in Ork hands and Imperial forces are fully committed to staving         off the green-skinned hordes threatening others.      <P>Beyond the planet itself, across the surrounding sector of space, more         Ork pirates and raiders are on the move against worlds left vulnerable         by the Imperial commitment to the Armageddon War. The most rapacious Ork         warlords are being drawn toward Armageddon itself like moths to a flame,         seeking fame and glory in the greatest battle ever known among their race.         The Muvva of All Battles is becoming a legend amongst the warlike Ork         race, with rumours abounding that Ghazghkull has begun the Ragna-Ork,         a final apocalyptic battle in which the Orks can truly prove their prowess         in the eyes of their violent, primitive gods.      <P><IMG SRC="images/ghazghkull.gif" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="144" ALIGN="RIGHT">The High Lords of Terra have a less prosaic view. The unification of so many         Ork tribes has long been feared by the Imperium. The Armageddon War must         continue - the sector cannot be allowed to collapse lest a tide of green-skinned         warriors comes to threaten even hallowed Terra itself. With over half         of its industry in ruins and casualties into the billions Armageddon needs         more troops, armaments and ships if it is to hold back the vast pressure         of the Ork menace from the heartland of the Imperium.      <P>Forces intended for the Tyrannic Wars on the Eastern Fringe have already         been diverted to Armageddon and a 10,000 light year recruitment zone has         been established around Armageddon. Every Imperial world within that zone         has had their tithe of Imperial Guard regiments tripled and their industry         turned over to armaments production. Imperial analysts predict that the         Ork Waaagh! on Armageddon cannot be maintained, that over a sustained         campaign the Orks supply lines will fail, that their losses cannot be         replaced.      <P>Those who have fought Orks before are less certain, knowing as they do         that resilience and improvisation are the Orks' greatest strengths. All         agree, however, that humanity's resolution cannot be dimmed and that human         flesh and blood will be the instruments of decision on Armageddon, not         tanks and guns. Armageddon remains a planet at war, a permanent battle         zone which promises to remain for decades to come. </font></span>    </TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><br><TABLE CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR="#F9E500 WIDTH="670" ALIGN=CENTER><TR><TD WIDTH="670" ALIGN=CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF0000"><B>HONOR ROLL</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT></P></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="670"><P><b>This colossal website has not been the undertaking of just one individual but the labour of love for a whole host of dedicated individuals.
