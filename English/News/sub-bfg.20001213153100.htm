ARMAGEDDON CAMPAIGN DRAWS TO A CLOSE!</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT></CENTER>            <P>&nbsp;             <font color="#00FF00"><b>October 24,2000</b> - Following the arrival             of four Ork fleets, Admiral Parol was forced to disengage and allow             the armada to approach Armageddon. The Orks subjected St Jowen's Dock             to a seven-day bombardment as they passed, which badly damaged its             repair facilities. The base was assaulted by impatient Ork ground             troops who fought with Navy armsmen and remained a threat to base             operations for weeks to come. </font>            <p><font color="#00FF00"> In addition to the Imperial Navy, the huge               build-up of Space Marine contingents on Armageddon itself had brought               together a vast fleet of Adeptus Astartes vessels commanded by High               Marshal Helbrecht of the Black Templars. </font>            <p><font color="#00FF00"> <img src="Images/parol.jpg" width="120" height="172" align="left">Most               of the assembled Space Marine companies deployed on the surface               to bolster the ground forces. The Space Marine fleet left Armageddon's               orbit just as the Orks arrived. A spectacular salvo of over a hundred               torpedoes was launched as a mark of defiance leaving the lead Ork               Hulk, Rumbeldeth, severely damaged, raging with internal fires.               Out of control, it entered low orbit where Armageddon's defence               lasers finished it off. </font>            <p><font color="#00FF00"> Both the Imperial Navy and the Space Marine               fleet now stood back and waited for Armageddon's planetary defences               to continue the process of wearing down the Ork juggernaut. Planetary               assaults are always costly to the attacker and the battle that followed               was no exception. The Orks achieved air superiority but only at               the cost of over 1,000 Fighta-Bommerz, leaving many Kroozers badly               depleted. The relocation of flyers to ground bases further reduced               the launch capacity of the fleet. The lack of attack craft was to               hamper the Ork fleet throughout the campaign. Compounding this problem,               every senior Ork commander relocated to the surface of Armageddon               at the first opportunity. The lure of face-to-face combat was simply               too much for the Orks and many ships were left with skeleton crews,               no clear commander and orders that rapidly ceased to be appropriate.               </font>            <p><font color="#00FF00"> While the landings commenced, Helbrecht               had brought the Space Marine fleet about and formed it into a wedge               directed at the hulk Rokdroppa which was responsible for the destruction               of Hades Hive. Broadcasting the single word 'Coward' in Ork on all               frequencies, the avenging fleet pummelled Rokdroppa with bombardment               cannons. The Black Dragons' Ebon Flame had the honour of avenging               Hades Hive. With its final volley against Rokdroppa the hulk simply               cracked down the middle. </font>            <p><font color="#00FF00"> Ork attempts to encircle the Space Marine               fleet were thwarted by the arrival of Admiral Parol and a specialist               nova cannon squadron based around the battleship His Will. Under               heavy bombardment, the Orks did not pursue the battle barges as               they withdrew. The battle became known as Helbrecht's Revenge and,               although a major victory in its own right, was more important as               proof that the fleet could prevail. </font>            <p><font color="#00FF00"> <img src="Images/arm.jpg" width="185" height="185" align="right">The               combined Imperial fleet had two distinct objectives. Firstly to               make sure that their forces were able to build up faster than the               Orks and secondly to eliminate as many space hulks as possible.               Irrespective of their planetary bombardment capabilities, these               huge vessels were the workshops and magazines that kept the Waaagh!               moving. </font>            <p><font color="#00FF00"> Parol established a blockade around the               Armageddon system. Over the weeks that followed, less and less Ork               support got through this ring of steel. The arrival of the Retribution               class battleship Glorious Age and its accompanying battle group               was the first sign of the shift of power. However, the Orks continued               to receive reinforcements in limited numbers by use of their long-range               tellyporta technology. The search for the transmitting ship was               focused around the edge of the system and intensified daily. </font>            <p><font color="#00FF00"> The space hulks were harder to get at since               Rokdroppa's destruction. Parol countered this by observing the locations               of the target hulks accurately and plotting their speed and heading.               Once an intercept point was calculated, a battle barge would accelerate               toward Armageddon from the edge of the system and suddenly cut power.               Drifting with no energy emissions to detect, the barge's trajectory               would be calculated to bring it close to the target hulk before               opening fire. To an experienced Fleet Admiral like Parol, Ghazghkull               had committed the classic soldier's error and nailed his fleet to               an objective rather than allowing it flexibility to fight as a fleet               should. As the Imperial system-wide blockade tightened, the Ork               dependence on their tellyportas increased and Parol's search for               the source of these reinforcements became more critical. When a               destroyer squadron reported contact with an Ork space hulk concealed               in the debris of Mannheim station, Parol led the chase. The space               hulk fled from the Armageddon system and attempted to escape into               the warp. </font>            <p><font color="#00FF00"> <img src="Images/jowen.jpg" width="185" height="155" align="left">The               speed, weaponry and handling of the hulk were superior to anything               Parol had encountered before and he became convinced that this space               hulk carried the Ork arch-mekaniak Orkimedes. Rather than let his               quarry escape, Parol attempted to grapple and board as the hulk               slipped into the warp. Hopes persist that Parol may have survived               but there is no evidence to assume anything other than the destruction               of both vessels. </font>            <p><font color="#00FF00"> Around Armageddon, Ghazghkull's fleet broke               orbit having picked up considerable numbers of ground troops and               unexpectedly started to move out-system. Helbrecht organised a pursuit               force that was quickly joined by Commissar Yarrick. Delays caused               by the need to retrieve Black Templars troops from Armageddon meant               that the Ork fleet was able to enter the immaterium safely. Yarrick               and Hellbrecht were not to be denied however, and set off in pursuit,               tracking the Ork fleet through the warp. </font>            <p><font color="#00FF00"> The departure of Ghazghkull and the loss               or departure of Parol, Helbrecht and Yarrick caused a pause to settle               over the fighting. The Imperial navy in particular failed to press               its advantage, although the repair of St Jowen's Dock and the opportunity               to repair crippled vessels justifies the inactivity. The Orks in               their turn gave up the planetary blockade of Armageddon and began               massing their fleets more effectively for mutual defence. Although               the initiative and the victories lie with the Imperium, the Ork               fleets still have superior numbers, leaving both sides to view the               coming months with trepidation. </font>             <CENTER><P><A HREF="Armageddon_Gothic_scenarios.pdf"><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Playing Games of Battlefleet Gothic During<BR>the Third War for Armageddon</B></FONT><BR>Gaming Ideas and Three All-New Battlefleet Gothic Scenarios<FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT></A></P></CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">If you want to get started playing games of Battlefleet Gothic set during the Third War for Armageddon, then you've come to the right place as this jam-packed .PDF file contains plenty of gaming tips for modifying the BFG scenarios from the rulebook for use during the Armageddon Campaign as well as three new scenarios: <B>The Gauntlet</B>, <B>Parol's Bait</B> and <B>The Defence of Pelucidar!</B> You need to have the Adobe Acrobat Reader<FONT SIZE=-1><sup>TM</sup></FONT> in order to read the file once you download it.
