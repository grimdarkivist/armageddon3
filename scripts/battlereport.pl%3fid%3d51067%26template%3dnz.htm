The landing pad was still in ork hands, but a detachment of Space Wolves had been sent to seize the control tower so the drop ship could land the much needed troops and supplies. The pilot made his final course adjustments and waited nervously for word the marines had been successful....
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Grimfang held onto the the armoured side of the battlewagon as it bounced across the cratered ground of the spaceport. His boyz had seen a beakie patrol heading for the 'umie control tower on the other side of the starport, and Grimfang wasn't about to let uninvited guests onto his turf.
As his force neared the control tower, the huge shape of a Landraider appeared from behind the building. the ork vehicles increased speed and scattered to avoid the tanks weaponry. Two bikers were not fast enough, and were blown apart by heavy bolter fire. A squadron of deth kopters skimmed low over the tower and spotted the rest of the beakie force - a converted sentinel and some sort of huge wheeled vehicle. From his turret Grimfang leaned forward as the behemoth came into view. It was the best 'umie trukk he had ever seen."What a grouse set of wheels - I's gonna 'ave dat for meself!" he roared as his battle wagon sped towards it's goal.
The dethkopta squadron moved into attack, but their shots bounced harmlessly of the battletrucks armour. Marine return fire sent all three flying machines crashing to the ground in a series of explosions. The land raider turned the corner and finished of the bike boys with it's heavy bolters. It's squad disembarked and fired into the nearest wartrakk, blasting it apart. Another warbuggy raced forward, only to have it's rokkit launcha blown off by the sentinel. 
Grimfang growled in frustration. His useless bunch of grots couldn't hit the side of a sqiggoth. Time to do this the old fashioned orky way. With a mughty yell of WAAAGH! the ork force drove into their enemy. The ork dred tore into the landraider, punching it's klaw into the tanks magazine and blowing it apart. Melta fire from the disembarked squad added the dred to the landraiders wreckage. Two trukks disgorged their boys into the two marine squads that dismounted from the beakie battletruck. The first marine squad fell quickly, but the Wolflord himself led the second, and they began to cut down the orks as the second squad of boys seized the tower. The disabled warbuggy rammed the battletruck, smashing it's wheels and immobilising it. The sentinel fired again, blasting another warbuggy before the rokkit launcha of one of the trukks silenced it.
The wolflord and his retinue continued to cut apart the trukk boyz. Only three were left standing when Grimfang and his nobz piled into the fray. Within seconds they had chopped apart the entire retinue, and only the wolflord remained. The spacewolf rained blows upon Grimfang with his chain sword, but the ork warboss simply laughed as his mega armoured turned aside the blows. With a roar grimfang swung his power klaw, crushing the marine commander.
The remaining marine squad saw the day was lost, and withdrew, vowing to avenge their fallen brothers.
Grimfang leaned down and pulled the pelt off the fallen wolflord. It would make a good seat cover for his newly aquired battle wagon.

High above, the "Angels Grace" aborted it's approach. The landing pad and tower were still controlled by the enemy. There would be no re-inforcements for the hard pressed imperial forces this day.</font></TD></TR></TABLE><BR CLEAR><TABLE WIDTH="170" ALIGN=CENTER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 BORDER=0 VALIGN=TOP><TR><TD><A HREF="/armageddon3/english/campaign/campaign_map.html"><img src="/armageddon3/scripts/BattleReportTemplates/images/3rdwarlogo.jpg" width=170 height=50 border=0></A></TD></TR></TABLE><CENTER><P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#FF0000">Use the link above to return to the 3rd War for Armageddon Campaign Map</FONT></P></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
