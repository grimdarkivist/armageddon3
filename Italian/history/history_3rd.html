Retiring to his stronghold - a network of systems controlled by his forces in the Golgotha Sector - he carried on with the master plan that had been revealed to him by Gork and Mork years before. If the Imperium made one terrible mistake following the Second Armageddon War it was to believe that Ghazghkull had been defeated. This was far from the truth. What the Ork gods had revealed to Ghazghkull, or rather what he said they had revealed to him, was that in order to destroy your foe you must first know him. For Ghazghkull, the war had been a way to learn how the Imperium would react and deal with a major invasion. In effect, Ghazghkull had been doing little more than testing the Imperium's defences.<p>In the decades that followed the war, Ghazghkull carried on with his master plan. Having learnt all he needed to know about Imperial strategy he began practising the tactics that he felt would lead to his enemies' defeat. As he did not want to draw undue attention to himself, these experiments were carried out on a much smaller scale than the invasion of Armageddon. From 945 to 959.M41 the Imperium received numerous reports of small raids and attacks against Imperial bases and outposts that were led by Ghazghkull Thraka personally. <p>Then, in 962.M41, an Imperial military base on Buca III was annihilated by missiles fired from an Ork base hidden on an asteroid. The asteroid entered the system from deep space and bypassed all the Imperial sensors undetected before unleashing its deadly missiles at the unsuspecting outpost. In 972.M41 the Imperial agri-world of Chigon 17 was overrun by a massive force of Orks allegedly under Ghazghkull's command. Despite the fact that the Imperial Guard defenders were well-equipped with tanks and other vehicles, they were defeated by the Orks in a lengthy guerrilla campaign which rendered the Imperial defences utterly useless. In 986.M41 the Imperial Battlecruiser, the Radiant Way and its attending escorts were lost with all hands in a sudden attack by Ork pirates, again led by Ghazghkull. The Imperium responded in force but discovered that the Orks had disappeared by the time they arrived. <p>Most recently, Ghazghkull allied with the Ork Warlord Nazdreg Ug Urdgrub to make a vicious assault on the Imperial planet Piscina IV. The Orks used a previously unknown type of teleportation device which enabled them to manoeuvre their troops directly onto the planet from a space hulk located a massive distance away from the planet. The Imperial garrison was taken completely by surprise and only the presence of Space Marines from the Dark Angels Chapter saved Piscina from being overrun by the alien hordes.<p>However, this second defeat was of little consequence to Ghazghkull, for, with the completion and testing of his new 'tellyporta', he was finally ready to unleash his full force against the Imperium. A plan that had been fifty years in the making was about to reach fruition...</TD><TD WIDTH="1" BGCOLOR="#FF0000" ALIGN=CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">.</FONT></P></TD><TD WIDTH="208" valign=top><font  size=-1 color="#1e90ff"><center><b>++++ LAST KNOWN TRANSMISSION FROM TASK FORCE TRAJAN ++++</b></center><p><b>Priority level:</b>	Military Intelligence-utmost urgency<p><b>Transmitted:</b>	Fire of Heaven, Fleet Flagship, Desedna System<p><b>Date:</b>	3453999.M41<p><b>Transmitter:</b>	Astropath Prime Spartax<p><b>Receiver:</b>	Astropath-terminus Ragnafar<p><b>Author:</b>	Admiral Trajan<p><b>Thought:</b>	Sorrow awaits the foolhardy<p>Over the last 48 hours (Earth standard), I have received transmissions from over two dozen Imperial planets in this sector, indicating that they are under attack from Ork raiders. Attacks are spread over a five hundred light year radius. All indications are of a major Ork assault on a scale unknown in living memory. In all cases the Ork attackers have appeared on the planet without warning, and have used the element of surprise to their advantage. Our best estimate is that seven sparsely populated worlds have already been lost (see attached sub-files Alpha 1-7 & Beta 8-29).</font><p><font  size=-1 color="#1e90ff">Upon learning of the Ork attack I positioned picket ships at the periphery of our system. Within the last hour their long range sensors have picked up Ork ships entering the outer reaches from deep space. I am proceeding to attack and destroy the invaders. We are the Emperor's sword!
