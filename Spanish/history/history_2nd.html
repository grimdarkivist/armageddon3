It is a vital node at the centre of the Armageddon sector's navigational channels and its thousands of weapons shops supply arms to Imperial Guard regiments several thousand light years away.</P><p>The loss of Armageddon would pose a serious threat to the Imperium's power in this area of the galaxy, as was proved when a massive Chaos host invaded in the mid-41st millennium. Although that titanic battle has long since passed into history, a more recent conflict has shown how vulnerable the Imperium's control is.</P><p>In 941.M41, the Ork Warlord Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka invaded Armageddon at the head of a massive Ork Waaagh. At the time, Armageddon was under the command of Overlord Herman von Strab, who was once described by Princeps Prime Kurtiz Mannheim of the Iron Skulls Titan Legion as "the greatest waste of flesh and bone born in the last five hundred years". It was von Strab's complete lack of preparation that cost the Imperium dearly. Even when a hulk of massive size was sighted in the Armageddon system, von Strab did nothing to investigate or report its appearance to other Imperial authorities. When the Orks crashed onto the western continent of Armageddon Prime, von Strab sent out his planetary defence regiments piecemeal, and they were smashed to pieces by the vastly superior Ork armies. Armageddon Prime quickly capitulated, its supply lines were cut and Ork warriors stormed through the tunnels of its hives. It was Commissar Yarrick who ordered the Astropaths to send a signal for aid, which earned him von Strab's displeasure and his subsequent exile to Hades Hive. However, it was this act which was to ultimately save Armageddon from Ghazghkull.</P><p>Von Strab was not concerned with the loss of Armageddon Prime, declaring that the Orks would never be able to cross the thick jungles that separated them from Armageddon Secundus. He was wrong. Ghazghkull's forces swept out of the jungles and embarked on a massive conquest, crossing the Stygies and Diabolus rivers and marching on the hives of Armageddon Secundus. Von Strab ordered Princeps Mannheim to lead his Titans into battle against the Ork armies, unsupported by other forces. Mannheim had little choice but to obey, though he knew that it would lead to the destruction of his forces.Although they inflicted heavy casualties on the Orks, the Legio Metallica were all but annihilated by the numerous Ork Gargants that opposed them. Everywhere the Imperial forces were being driven back in disarray.</P><p>The Orks swept onwards, storming Infernus Hive as the Season of Storms broke in full fury. Refugees numbering in tens of thousands marched across the inhospitable ash dunes, dying from exposure to the harsh environment or falling prey to the rampaging mobs of Ork Speed Freeks, which constantly harried them in their flight. As the Orks moved southwards they split, descending on the Hades and Helsreach Hives. When the Orks besieged the massive cities, von Strab unleashed a secret weapon, a massive stock of virus bombs from his personal arsenals. However, the ancient devices frequently malfunctioned and although they took a heavy toll on the unprotected Orks, many humans were lost too as missiles flew out of control and plunged into Imperium lines or exploded in the refugee camps. At Helsreach, converted supertankers took those unable to fight across the Tempest Ocean and, once the last ship had left, those who remained grimly swore to defend the city to the last man. Suicide teams charged into the Ork encampments and detonated homemade explosives, while the dockside loaders welded themselves into the armoured cabs of their cranes and fought with the gigantic Gargants <IMG SRC="images/history_orc2.gif" HEIGHT=226 WIDTH=155 align="right">rampaging across the city. The fighting was bitter, but in the end, Helsreach fell to the Orks.</P><p>Although the battle for Armageddon had been ferocious, it was at Hades Hive that the conflict entered a new stage of savagery and fierceness. Led by Commissar Yarrick, the defenders of Hades Hive fought as though they were possessed. The Orks made so little headway against such stiff resistance that Ghazghkull himself joined the attack, leading his forces from the front. Thus the stage was set for the greatest contest of wills in the entire war. For weeks, Ghazghkull tried every stratagem taught to him by Gork and Mork, making lightning assaults and feints, attacking in massive waves and trying to reduce the hive by bombardment. Yarrick countered every ploy: sending out sabotage parties to destroy the Ork Warlord's siege engines, counter-attacking along a flank when the Orks tried to storm the barricades, and falling back from diversionary attacks to draw the Orks into ambushes. When Ghazghkull mustered all of his Kommandos into a huge infiltration force, Yarrick assembled volunteer cadres of men who were once maintenance workers in the labyrinth of the hive’s air and fuel ducts. A deadly battle was fought in the darkness between these drug-crazed psychopaths and the Ork Kommandos, and in the end it is said that not a single Kommando escaped alive.</P><CENTER><P><A HREF="history_2nd_2.html"><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>More...</B></FONT><FONT SIZE="-1"> </FONT></A></P></CENTER><CENTER><P><A HREF="http://www.games-workshop.com/front1.html"><img src="/armageddon3/Images/gwlogo.gif" width=250 height=47 border=0></a></P></CENTER></TD><TD WIDTH="1" BGCOLOR="#FF0000" ALIGN=CENTER><P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">.</FONT></P></TD><TD WIDTH="208" valign=top><CENTER><P><IMG SRC="Images/freetext.gif" HEIGHT=30 WIDTH=208 alt="Free!
